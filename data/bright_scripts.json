In therapy I mean, that\u2019s...probably obvious. I\u2019m Sam, Samantha, my name is Samantha Barnes but you can call me Sam. Or Samantha. Either one is fine, whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. It\u2019s your office.",
        "Dr. Bright: Which would you prefer?",
        "Sam: Uh Sam, I suppose, if I had to pick.",

        "Dr. Bright: No, you\u2019re not required to lie down. What did you mean by that?",
        "Sam: By what?",
        "Dr. Bright: That comment about Freud.",
        "Sam: Oh, that. Um, nothing, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I mean, I don\u2019t know Freud personally or anything. I- I mean it\u2019s not a personal interest of mine. I- I probably just read something somewhere about Freud and his intense need for people to lie down while talking to him. I\u2019m a researcher so I spend a lot of time on the computer and you know the Internet, just full of information...so, yes I probably just read about Freud while I was doing my...Internet...ing. I mean, I\u2019m sure you know all about Freud, being a psychiatrist and all.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve read his works, yes.",
        "Sam: Right well so that\u2019s uh- that\u2019s a relief. That I don\u2019t have to lie down that is. Just...seems silly.",
        "Dr. Bright: So, Sam, how are you feeling today?",
        "Sam: Good. I\u2019m good, uhh great yeah uhh, things are great.",
        "Dr. Bright: Is there anything in particular that\u2019s on your mind?",
        "Sam: No no, not really. I don\u2019t really need therapy or anything. I mean I\u2019m not, you know, depressed or suicidal. I mean, I have a nice life. A job I like, a nice apartment, a- a very understanding cat. Things are good. I just, um, yeah I saw your- your listing in the paper and it looked intriguing, that\u2019s all.",
        "Dr. Bright: What about it intrigued you?",
        "Sam: Well, \u2018Therapy for the strange and unusual\u2019? I just...it sounded, well, unusual.",
        "Dr. Bright: And you like things that are unusual?",
        "Sam: No I, I would not, I would not say that, exactly.",
        "Dr. Bright: Then why did the listing attract you?",
        "Sam: What did you, what did you mean by it? I mean, why put a listing in the paper for therapy in the first place? It seems a- a little weird.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve learned that some people have problems that aren\u2019t exactly found in psychology textbooks and a lot of those people don\u2019t know where to turn for help. That\u2019s where I come in.",
        "Sam: What do you mean? What, what kinds of problems?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t discuss any of my past or present patients.",
        "Sam: Right, right, of course you can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just...I think I might qualify for that? For the...the strange and unusual?",
        "Dr. Bright: Oh? Why do you say that?",
        "Sam: Well ever since I was a kid... wait you can\u2019t tell anyone about this, right? I mean the same patient-doctor confidentiality agreement still applies?",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. I can\u2019t tell anyone what you tell me in this office.",
        "Sam: And you can\u2019t report me to any law enforcement or government agency or anything, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, if you\u2019ve hurt someone or plan to, I would have-",
        "Sam: No, no, no, no, no I, oh god it\u2019s nothing like that, it\u2019s just (takes a breath) well, okay you will probably think that I am completely insane. I mean I think I\u2019m completely insane, I have thought for fifteen years but well...here\u2019s the thing. Ever since I was a kid, I\u2019ve been able to do this- this thing that for all intents and purposes should not be possible. And I\u2019ve read every book that I can get my hands on and I have scoured what feels like the entire Internet and I\u2019ve never come across any kind of explanation for it...and you probably will not believe me but, essentially, unbelievably...I can time travel. And it sucks!",
        "Dr Bright: You don\u2019t enjoy it?",
        "Sam: What? No I mean it\u2019s- wait, aren\u2019t you just a little bit curious about the whole \u2018I can time travel\u2019 thing, I mean doesn\u2019t that seem a little weird to you?",
        "Dr. Bright: It is certainly...atypical but no stranger than anything else I\u2019ve ever heard.",
        "Sam: Wow. Wow that\u2019s- really? I guess that\u2019s sort of- sort of comforting. Have you- have you ever met anyone that- that can do what I do?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m afraid that pesky doctor-patient confidentiality means that-",
        "Sam: Right, of course. That makes sense. It would just be nice to know if someone had the same condition.",
        "Dr. Bright: Condition. Why do you call it that?",
        "Sam: Well, it\u2019s sort of...involuntary? I mean, it\u2019s not like I hop into the TARDIS and sail off through time. I just go - unexpectedly at any time. I- I don\u2019t have a choice, it just happens.",
        "Dr. Bright: Can you elaborate on that?",
        "Sam: Um, I get this sort of lightheaded dizzy feeling and then...my vision go hazy and I get this [sfx: writing on paper] like this weird intense tightness in my chest? And, and poof! I disappear, or at least I assume I disappear. I mean, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never seen it from the other side. Obviously. And then I, you know, just reappear. Usually just a few minutes later, regardless of how much time I spend in the other place.",
        "Dr. Bright: And no one has even seen this happen?",
        "Sam: Um, I just tend to avoid...um. People.",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t have family? Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Friends?",
        "Sam: My parents are dead. Umm and I\u2019m an only child so...",
        "[sfx: writing on paper] ",
        "Dr. Bright: Where do you go when you disappear? Or, I suppose I should ask, when?",
        "Sam: I go everywhere, every time I mean. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes it\u2019s significant historical events, sometimes there isn\u2019t another living soul around. I really have seen Freud though. I\u2019ve accidentally sat in on a few of his sessions. Those trips are okay. Not too eventful but usually pretty interesting.",
        "Dr. Bright: And Freud doesn\u2019t mind the intrusion?",
        "Sam: How could he?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Sam: He couldn\u2019t see me. They can never see me, I\u2019m just there. It\u2019s like being stuck inside someone else\u2019s memory or something. I can move around but I can\u2019t talk. I\u2019m basically a ghost. Or, like, a reverse ghost. Not dead but invisible. Or, well, not even born yet I guess. Ugh, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Dr. Bright: That- that must be difficult.",
        "Sam: It\u2019s horrible.",
        "Dr. Bright: And you say this has been happening since you were a child?",
        "Sam: Yes. I think I was, um, 10 years old when it first happened? I was so scared, um, but- but it was also kind of exciting too. I remember I went back to ancient Greece. It was- it was really cool to be honest. When I came back, I thought I\u2019d just fallen asleep and had the most vivid dream ever. Um, the second time it happened I knew I wasn\u2019t just dreaming.",
        "Dr. Bright: And when was that?",
        "Sam: About a year later. The trips didn\u2019t happen very frequently when they first started but, um, when- when I was a teenager they uhhh they started happening all the time.",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think the trips increased?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Dr. Bright: May I ask, what happens on these trips? You begin to feel ill, you disappear, and then ...what happens next?",
        "Sam: Well, um, I open my eyes and I\u2019m somewhere else. Sometimes it takes me a little while to figure out where exactly, especially if I\u2019m out in the countryside or there\u2019s no one else around. But sometimes it\u2019s really obvious, like Greece was or Victorian England or the Civil War. Oh god, that was very loud.",
        "Dr. Bright: It must be very interesting. Seeing these things that are only familiar to us through history books. You get to witness events that no one else does.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I guess. It was definitely really at first but umm now I\u2019m just tired. I honestly think I would just prefer to go to an IMAX movie. It\u2019d probably smell a lot better.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m curious Sam, why come to therapy now? After all these years?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know, just fed up I guess. This week I turned twenty five. And my parents...well, in their will...well I got the rest of the family money on my twenty fifth birthday. And it\u2019s a lot of money and you know, what- what am I supposed to do with it? Share it with all the friends that I don\u2019t have? Save it for a big wedding that will never happen? I mean what\u2019s the point of buying a nice house or traveling around the world if I can\u2019t enjoy any of it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why wouldn\u2019t you be able to enjoy any of it?",
        "Sam: Because I can\u2019t enjoy anything! I\u2019m terrified all the time. When I\u2019m not actively disappearing I\u2019m worried about disappearing. I\u2019m worried about, about being caught, about hurting someone, about not coming back. When I go away, I\u2019m nowhere. I\u2019m invisible. I\u2019m no one. And it\u2019s not better here, where I have no life, no friends. I don\u2019t exist anywhere! I\u2019m so scared of everything and I\u2019m starting. To lose. My mind!",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, Sam you do exist. You\u2019re here. Right now. With me. You are important and you are a part of this world, even though it seems like you can simply vanish, you will never truly-Sam? Are you alright? You look very pale.",

        "Caleb: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you agree that the witches took away Macbeth's free will?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. Not- not really \u2013 all they did was make a bunch of prophecies that they knew Macbeth would like. I mean, he was still the one that killed people.",

        "Dr. Bright: No, she\u2019s not a very likable character.",
        "Caleb: I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible - making someone do something, just because you know what\u2019s going on in their head. Macbeth was already ambitious; the witches couldn\u2019t control him just because they knew that, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you think?",
        "Caleb: No, no, I don\u2019t think they could.",
        "Dr. Bright: Remember, in the same way that Macbeth chose to murder; the witches and Lady Macbeth choose to manipulate. It doesn\u2019t matter what information you have. It\u2019s about what you choose to do with it.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, are you worried about making someone do something they don\u2019t want to do?",

        "Dr. Bright: And it makes you sad?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, no shit. It makes me sad. Whenever he\u2019s in the room I can\u2019t feel anything else. I-I just feel his- his stupid emo-ness crawling all over me and it\u2019s just- it\u2019s not fair, okay? I don\u2019t care that he\u2019s sad, a lot of people are sad, just fucking deal with it! What does it have to do with me?",
        "Dr. Bright: Remember what we talked about, Caleb. Responding with anger is not productive. ",
        "Caleb: Okay, I know you say that, but I think- I think you\u2019re wrong. When I get angry the other stuff goes away.",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019re not dealing with it. You\u2019re overpowering it.",
        "Caleb: Why is that a bad thing?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because it\u2019s a temporary solution. Caleb, you have a wonderful gift. Being able to feel other people\u2019s emotions is something many people would be thankful for. I know it would certainly make my job a lot easier. When you try to drown that out with anger and frustration, you muddy the waters. You need to learn to take in each feeling and balance them alongside your own emotions. I know that\u2019s easier said than done.",
        "Caleb: No kidding. I can\u2019t balance shit if I\u2019m walking down a hallway of a hundred students who all have their own stupid problems and emotions. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s like, suffocating, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Other students\u2019 problems are not stupid. Everyone had their own burdens to bear-",
        "Caleb: Yeah, so why should I have to bear all of them? I didn\u2019t ask for this! I don\u2019t wanna- I don\u2019t wanna deal with this anymore!",
        "Dr. Bright: Your mother told me she wants to get you at home tutoring. I know you have an easier time with adults. Have you considered taking her up on her offer?",
        "Caleb: I wouldn\u2019t be able to play on the football team, if I did home school. Adults are better, but spending all day with one person is hard. I started feeling only what they are feeling and I don\u2019t like that. It\u2019s like- like having someone else inside of my chest, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. I have to say I\u2019m surprised you find football enjoyable still. Don\u2019t your teammates\u2019 emotions get in the way of the game?",
        "Caleb: Not really. Look, it\u2019s easier when everyone is feeling the same thing. Football is intense. But it\u2019s- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s simple.",
        "Dr. Bright: Hmm. You said that when Adam is in the room you can\u2019t feel anything else. Do you mean his are the only other emotions that you feel?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, pretty much. He just sort of...drowns everything else out.",
        "Dr. Bright: Isn\u2019t that preferable to feeling what everyone in the class feels? You don\u2019t sound very happy about it.",
        "Caleb: No, of course I\u2019m not happy about it, that\u2019s literally the point. I can\u2019t be happy because he\u2019s so miserable.",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you know why he\u2019s sad?",
        "Caleb: No, how the fuck would I know that, I\u2019m not a mind-reader! Look, I just- I just know that he\u2019s sad.",
        "Dr. Bright: In previous sessions, you\u2019ve talked about how similar emotions can have slightly different colors to them. Happiness over getting a good grade versus happiness over seeing a friend, for example. You feel that difference. It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve felt many times in school, correct? Those different colors?",
        "Caleb: Sounds a little gay when you when you put it like that, but yeah I guess...",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb.",
        "Caleb: Sorry.",
        "Dr. Bright: So does Adam sadness have a special color to it? Is he sad over his grades? His family?",
        "Caleb: Like I said, I\u2019m not a mind reader. But I mean, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s pretty general. He\u2019s lonely, I guess. Yeah, he feels alone. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends, so I guess that makes sense. Actually I don\u2019t think he has, like, any friends...so.",
        "Dr. Bright: Perhaps that\u2019s why you only feel him when he\u2019s around. His loneliness isolates you from feeling anything else.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, maybe. I mean- look, people are sad and lonely all the time, it\u2019s high school. He\u2019s just- he\u2019s just different for some reason.",
        "Dr. Bright: You said you made something worse this week? Did that have to do with Adam?",
        "Caleb: What? Um yeah. Yeah it did.",
        "Dr. Bright: What happened?",
        "Caleb: Well, we did our presentations on Macbeth. Mine went pretty okay. I mean, I basically just read off the Spark Notes for it, so...what? Everyone does it. Anyway, he gets up there and he gives this, like, really long, really weird presentation about the witches and symbolism and and King James and I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really understand any of it. It seemed pretty smart, I guess. Mr. Collins was impressed. But all of us were like \u201cwho does this nerd think he is?\u201d. It was just really show-off-y.",
        "Dr. Bright: And that bothered you?",
        "Caleb: I mean, a little. It wa just- it was just really annoying but at least he wasn\u2019t sad during it. He was just focused. So, you know, that was a little bit of a relief. But it bothered some of the other guys.",
        "Dr. Bright: What other guys?",
        "Caleb: Some of the guys from the team. They were giving him a hard time about it after class, calling him names and stuff, pushing him around. You know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you apart of this behavior?",
        "Caleb: No, I mean, why would I want to make him worse? It was just going to make me feel worse.",
        "Dr. Bright: And did you? Feel worse?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I did. I mean he was just starting to get really sad again and really angry. The dude\u2019s got a lot of anger. Like, way more than I would have thought. And it was making me really mad. So, I asked them to stop bothering him.",
        "Dr. Bright: And did they?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, they walked away.",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t understand the problem then. It sounds like you did a really good thing, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, except- expect when I told them to back off. I said \u201cleave him alone the dude\u2019s sad enough as it is. Can\u2019t you see that? He just- he wants to be left alone.\u201d Andthen look on his face, he just looked so embarrassed and I could feel him getting even more depressed. And scared. I just- I think it was the wrong thing to say. And now I\u2019ve made him sad and scared. I was just trying to help and I\u2019ve just made him feel worse.",
        "Dr. Bright: Sometimes, people don\u2019t want others to see their sadness. He probably thought he was hiding it well and the fact that you noticed frightened him. It brought into focus just how unhappy he is.",
        "Caleb: See what I mean? I knew how he was feeling and instead of fixing it, I made him more unhappy. You\u2019re always talking about this like it\u2019s some sort of stupid gift, that I can help people. But I always just fuck things up.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s because you haven\u2019t learned how to control it yet. You\u2019re so young and you\u2019re dealing with so many of your own emotions that handling others\u2019 is going to be overwhelming. Being a teenager is hard, you know that. I\u2019ve said before that I think this ability get easier as you grow older-",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know, I know. Being a teenager is rough, there are hormones and all that stuff, blah, blah, blah. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that I suck. It\u2019s not an excuse. Someone was sad and then I opened my mouth and now they\u2019re sadder. And I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do or how he\u2019s gonna react, or if he spent the whole weekend thinking about it- and would you stop that! I can feel your fucking pity bleeding out of you and I don\u2019t need it! I\u2019m not some pathetic emotional loser, okay? I\u2019m not like him!",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, okay, Caleb. Caleb, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t pity you. I\u2019m empathetic to what you are feeling. Surely you of all people can understand that, right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Sure. Look I\u2019m sorry, I just- your feelings are normally pretty quiet and- so, it just surprised me, that\u2019s all.",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. I think you are being too hard on yourself. You are not responsible for what other people feel. But, as I was saying earlier, you can choose how to respond to it. You need to get these outbursts under control. Think before you speak. And that will only be possible if you learn to filter the incoming emotions. I think it\u2019s possible you\u2019re not in control of your own feelings because they are being overpowered by others, that\u2019s why you need to learn to balance them.",
        "Caleb: Yeah I know. I just- I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt. That\u2019s all.",
        "Dr. Bright: I have an idea. I think you\u2019ve been given a unique opportunity.",
        "Caleb: Awesome, more unique opportunities...",
        "Dr. Bright: If you couldn\u2019t do what you could do, do you think you would have noticed that Adam felt worse after you intervened?",
        "Caleb: No, I guess not. But, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in the first place if I couldn\u2019t do what I do.",
        "Dr. Bright: I just mean that you know now, that he\u2019s feeling worse. And maybe you can help make that better. Make the choice. I think you should talk to him on Monday. Try and become friends.",
        "Caleb: Why the hell would I do that?",
        "Dr. Bright: You said yourself that he\u2019s lonely. He could probably use someone who understands what\u2019s going on with him. And it might help whatever misplaced feeling of guilt you have if you befriend him.",
        "Caleb: Using my ability to make someone feel a certain way is exactly what I\u2019m trying to avoid. Isn\u2019t that an abuse of power or something?",
        "Dr. Bright: Is it?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Adam\u2019s feelings are having a profound effect on you for a reason. I think you owe it to both him and yourself to find out what that reason is. If his emotions are so overpowering, perhaps it will help you learn focus and control to get some one-on-one time with him. Learn to contain both his feeling and yours.",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. That sounds a little- sounds a little weird to me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Promise me you\u2019ll at least try? Ask him to have lunch with you this week and try to get to know him. Focus on the feelings that are coming from him and see if you can control how much it affects you. Will you do that?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, okay. I mean I\u2019ll try.",
        "Dr. Bright: Thank you. Now, let\u2019s work on your mediation exercises.",
        "[sfx: clock ticking] ",
        "(time passes)",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright, Caleb. I think that\u2019s enough for today. Do your exercises at home and remember what we talked about. Make contact with Adam this week and see what comes of it.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I will.",

        "Dr. Bright: No one believes you about what?",
        "Chloe: About any of it! They keep telling me I need medication and they\u2019re wrong. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why don\u2019t we start from the beginning. What made you seek therapy in the first place?",
        "Chloe: I started to hear things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What kinds of things?",
        "Chloe: At first I wasn\u2019t sure. It was just quiet murmuring, like being next to a bee hive - a steady hum. (with wonder) And then things started to break through the hum and that\u2019s when they started talking to me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Who started talking to you?",
        "Chloe: The angels. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You believe that angels are speaking to you?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t believe it - it\u2019s true. None of the others believed me and now you don\u2019t either. You were supposed to be different. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t believe you, Chloe. I\u2019m just trying to understand. Your mother sent you to me - do you know why?",
        "Chloe: She said you would be able to help me like you helped her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s my hope. I met your mother when I was getting my masters - she was working at the university at the time and we became good friends. She was dealing with a...special ability and - has she ever told you about it?",
        "Chloe: Yes - I didn\u2019t think anyone else knew. ",
        "Dr. Bright:  Yes, well, I think I was the first person she ever confided in about it. And she was one of my first patients. I helped her learn to control it. ",
        "Chloe: Whoa. And it didn\u2019t freak you out? That she could move things like that?",
        "Dr. Bright: I was certainly surprised at first but then... it was amazing. I\u2019d never dreamed that- well, your mother is very unique and it seems you\u2019ve inherited some of that.",
        "Chloe: So you believe me then - about the angels?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why don\u2019t you tell me more about these angels. How often do they speak to you?",
        "Chloe: Oh, all the time. They\u2019re speaking to me right now. It\u2019s a little quieter than usual at the moment - they like to give me some space and be a little less noisy when I\u2019m by myself or in a quiet place. They\u2019re very respectful like that.Well, most of the time.",
        "Dr. Bright: When are they not respectful?",
        "Chloe: Well, if I\u2019m in a busy place, like the campus dining hall, or driving home in rush hour, they can get really, really loud and they all try to talk at once and it gets to be a little much. That\u2019s why I had to go to therapy in the first place. One of my professors made me see the college mental health advisor after I had a bit of an outburst during a lecture. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What caused the outburst?",
        "Chloe: Well, I was trying to take notes on the found art movement - I\u2019m an Art major - and there were so many voices getting in the way. Some of it was about the lecture - sometimes the angels try to be helpful, I know they mean well - but there was so much other stuff too and it was just too much and I couldn\u2019t concentrate and everyone was looking at me, and I just sort of...lost it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. Is it always like that when you\u2019re in a big group?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, mostly. It\u2019s best when I\u2019m in my studio. I do sculptures - mostly with clay - and I work at this outdoor studio on campus and I think the angels really like it because they always say the nicest things when I\u2019m working. Even when the studio is full, they are always saying the nicest things.",
        "Dr. Bright: What do they say?",
        "Chloe: They just talk about art. It\u2019s beautiful - the flow of artistic inspiration, all these different ideas - my art has reached new heights since they started talking to me. It\u2019s like they\u2019re all working on their own pieces and they tell me about them and it just elevates my own artistic thought. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That sounds lovely. But lectures are still difficult for you?",
        "Chloe: Um, I- I haven\u2019t been to any since. After I talked to the school counselor, she told me to seek more \u201cofficial psychological evaluation\u201d. So I went to go see a therapist and that\u2019s when I got my first diagnosis. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what was that diagnosis?",
        "Chloe: Schizophrenia. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said that was the first diagnosis - you saw another psychiatrist after that?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I saw two more before coming to you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And they said the same thing? Schizophrenia? ",
        "Chloe: Yes. But they\u2019re wrong! I\u2019m not schizophrenic. I\u2019m not paranoid, I\u2019m not seeing things - I\u2019m not crazy! ",
        "Dr. Bright: No one is calling you crazy, Chloe. But auditory hallucinations are very serious. ",
        "Chloe: They\u2019re not hallucinations! What the angels are telling me is true. I know it is because that\u2019s why I\u2019m here with you.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry? I don\u2019t follow. ",
        "Chloe: I moved back in with my parents after it all started and last week, I was sitting in the kitchen with my mom, trying to help her cook, but there were too many voices and it got to be a little much, so I sat down and put my head in between my knees because sometimes that makes me feel better, and then this little voice starts telling me things about my mom. I\u2019m an only child but the angel was saying my mom had a daughter before me but she died. And I didn\u2019t know that and it made me so sad so I asked my mom about it and she was so surprised. I wasn\u2019t supposed to know, but the angel told me because my mom was thinking about her baby and it was making her sad about how I was sick. She was worried that something was going to happen to me too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The angel said your mother was thinking about the baby in that moment?",
        "Chloe: No, that\u2019s what my mom said. She was so shocked, because she had never told me about my sister and she said she had just been thinking about her. She said it was like I had read her mind. And that\u2019s when she told me that I needed to come see you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I see why she would want that. Chloe, I think your mother is right. I think it\u2019s possible you\u2019re hearing the thoughts of other people. ",
        "Chloe: Wait, what? That\u2019s a bit science-fiction-y isn\u2019t it? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Really? That seems strange to you? I\u2019m sorry - I just- I\u2019m surprised you find that harder to believe than angels speaking to you. ",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s not my place to question the methods of the universe. She moves in mysterious ways and will send messages in whatever way she pleases. I\u2019ve always felt a deep connection to the cosmos - it\u2019s clearly trying to push me on a certain path. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think that?",
        "Chloe: Because the angels tell me things that will help people. Like telling me about my sister - now my mom can talk to me about it and unburden herself. She doesn\u2019t have to feel alone anymore.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: What else have the angels told you that have helped someone?",
        "Chloe: Well...nothing else yet. It\u2019s- it\u2019s hard to sort through all of them at once. They all talk over each other and I get snippets here and there. It\u2019s easier when I\u2019m with one other person, like with my mom. Or the college therapist. The angels told me she was way out of her depth and worried she was going to say something wrong to me so I tried to take it easy on her. You know, not overwhelm her too much with my energy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That was kind of you. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s possible that what you were hearing were the actual thoughts of the therapist? How exactly do these \u201cangels\u201d communicate with you? Do you hear full sentences?",
        "Chloe: Not so much, no. I don\u2019t really know how to describe it - it\u2019s like hearing the lyrics to a song that\u2019s playing in the background. You\u2019re not paying attention, but a word or two sneaks it\u2019s way into your brain and maybe you get the idea of the song just from these few words and the melody and - does that make sense? I can\u2019t pick out individual words exactly, but I just- I just know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. And you can\u2019t choose not to listen, I gather?",
        "Chloe: No, no, it\u2019s always there. And I can\u2019t really choose to listen either if you know what I mean. Like I said, it\u2019s not like I can focus on the words and pull out full ideas - they just come into my mind and then I understand them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you hearing them now?",
        "Chloe: Yep. Though they\u2019re being quieter than normal. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What are you hearing? Or, should I say, what are you understanding?",
        "Chloe: Um, I\u2019m not sure. Things don\u2019t always come through - it\u2019s a little unfocused at the moment. Someone\u2019s worried about their next patient? Oh that- that must be you, I guess. Are you worried about your next patient?",
        "Dr. Bright: How-? Um,  yes, I suppose I am. But I wasn\u2019t actively thinking about him in that moment. ",
        "Chloe: Are you sure you should being doing therapy with this person? When you\u2019re so worried about them being dangerous? It\u2019s not worth it if they might hurt you. ",
        "Dr. Bright:  That\u2019s - that really isn\u2019t any of your business. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m- I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean-",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s alright, Chloe, you just, uh, you surprised me, is all. You were right. I am concerned for my next patient. He- this person is a difficult case and I\u2019m not sure I can help them. But I wasn\u2019t thinking about that when you heard it - I was very much focused on you. ",
        "Chloe: See? I told you I wasn\u2019t hearing people\u2019s thoughts. It has to be some outside source - that\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. This patient is certainly on my mind - not actively, but in the back, somewhere between my current thoughts and my subconscious. I think it\u2019s possible that\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so scattered and hard to sift through. Humans are capable of thinking about so much at once that I\u2019m not surprised it\u2019s an unclear connection. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, maybe. I guess we\u2019ll never know for sure. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Says who? Chloe, I think you can learn to control this ability - focus it. It will become less distracting to you and perhaps you\u2019ll be able to actively listen and pick out the thoughts. But I think that\u2019s probably enough for today. Consider this a preliminary consultation - we can start full sessions next week if you\u2019re interested in working with me. I just need to look at some of my notes and see what methods I can come up with. ",
        "Chloe: Oh, okay, right, that would be good, I think. If you really think you can help me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I think I can. Okay, so until next week, then. I want you to continue to avoid large groups and see if you can focus more on listening when you\u2019re one on one with someone. ",

This is going to be a difficult obstacle to overcome in treating her. She cannot be allowed to hear my thoughts, but I have to teach her to control her listening. In the next week, I will attempt self-hypnotism and meditation in order to control my own thought processes and limit what she can hear from me.

        "Sam: Okay. Um, well, this one time I ended up in New York in the twenties. I think I was...uh, 15 or so? So things were still pretty fresh and exciting. And I- well, I only spent a night there - but it was so interesting, I saw so much. Gosh, everyone was dressed so beautifully and the city just glittered. I\u2019ve never been to New York City - well, past 1950 that is - so I don\u2019t know how it compares, but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s half as lovely now. I had arrived in Times Square, so I just wandered around there for a bit and ended up at something called The Follies? It was a- a dance show with these amazing costumes and dancing women and, well, it was just really neat. And the people sitting behind me were talking about going to the jazz clubs in Harlem after the show. The Cotton Club I think, and I thought, \u201cwell, that sounds fun, I\u2019ll just follow them\u201d. See, that\u2019s the trick, to find some interesting people to follow around. Gosh, the first few times I traveled, I was so overwhelmed trying to take everything in that eventually I learned to pick just one thing to focus on. But if you choose wrong, it can be so boring. People\u2019s day-to-day lives can be incredibly mundane. I mean, I suppose I can\u2019t throw stones - my day-to-day life is pretty mundane. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, you were just talking about visiting the Cotton Club in the 1920s. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call that mundane. ",
        "Sam: Well, no, I guess you\u2019re right - it\u2019s not. But, you know, when I'm not- when I\u2019m not in other places, I lead a pretty simple life. Some might even call it boring. ",

        "Sam: Okay, um, well, I followed this group into a cab, it was a pretty tight squeeze but I don\u2019t really have any you know, physical presence when I\u2019m in other times, so I don\u2019t think they noticed - and we drove uptown and they were all laughing and drinking. Which I know was illegal but they all had flasks and the cab driver didn\u2019t seem to mind. And they were just so happy. I remember thinking how nice it would be to have friends like that. Well, just to have friends at all, actually. But anyway, when we got to the club - well it was just- it was some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. And everyone was so wild - I remember, I had just finished reading The Great Gatsby in school and it was just like that. Loud music, energetic dancing, alcohol flowing - I think we were out until 5am. And then just as the sun was coming up, I came back. Wow, I\u2019ve never said any of that out loud before. It sounds completely crazy,  right? I mean, it sounds like someone\u2019s dream. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It does sound pretty spectacular, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. I believe you, Sam. I believe that you traveled to 1920s New York and you saw all that. It\u2019s fantastic, yes, but - as they say - the truth is often stranger than fiction. ",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t think whoever came up with that phrase was really thinking of this kind of situation. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I suppose not. You said you were reading The Great Gatsby at the time? ",
        "Sam: Yes, for English class. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you read arguably the most famous book about New York in the twenties and then you went there - that seems like quite a coincidence, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: I know. I remember thinking that at the time. That maybe I could control where I go. But it\u2019s not like that all the time. Especially as I got older, the places I went just seemed more and more random. And even if I could control where I go, I don\u2019t think I can ever control leaving in the first place. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think that?",
        "Sam: Because, it\u2019s always so sudden. It just comes out of nowhere and I don\u2019t exactly have time to think of where I want to go or prepare or anything like that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Last session you talked about the physical sensations that precede an episode, but are there any emotional ones? What were you doing before going to the twenties? What kind of emotional state were you in?",
        "Sam: Um, well, I don\u2019t really remember. I mean, it was a long time ago. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. Just try. Think back to that time. To the moments leading up to the trip. ",
        "Sam: I was in the kitchen, uh, with my mom and I was doing homework I think. And then I started to get that feeling that I get - the tightness in my chest, the light-headedness, so I went into the bathroom where I could be alone and I, you know, went away. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Had your mother said anything to you? Maybe something that triggered a reaction?",
        "Sam: Um, no, I don\u2019t think so. She was cooking dinner and I was doing my work so we weren\u2019t really talking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Do you remember the work that you were doing?",
        "Sam: You know what? I- I think it was the English assignment actually. Our essays on The Great Gatsby. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you enjoying writing it? ",
        "Sam: Um, no, no I wasn\u2019t. I was really worried about it, actually. I remember thinking that I wasn\u2019t going to get it done on top of all my other schoolwork and yeah, yeah, I was really worried about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And the other times you\u2019ve traveled? Have you been worried about things?",
        "Sam: Yes! Yes, it\u2019s- well, I get anxious sometimes. I\u2019m not always working on something but sometimes I just get nervous about getting things done, or- or going grocery shopping or having to talk to someone. Or last week, with you! Is that- do you think that\u2019s causing it? Like, panic attacks or something?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, Sam, I think that might be exactly it. The physical symptoms you\u2019ve described align very closely with those of a typical panic attack. I think you may have an anxiety disorder and your panic attacks are just a little different than most people\u2019s. ",
        "Sam: That\u2019s putting it mildly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, yes. But this is good news. There are methods people adopt to deal with panic attacks - perhaps the same methods would work with you.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve heard of those kinds of things before. But, I just don\u2019t really think that\u2019ll work on me? I mean, I\u2019ll barely have any time to do any breathing or whatever it is before I disappear. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then maybe it\u2019s about changing your lifestyle a little bit. Learning to handle the day to day stresses and lower your anxiety. ",
        "Sam: Can\u2019t you just - I don\u2019t know, can\u2019t you just give me some medication or something? I mean, if you really think that this is some sort of bizarre anxiety disorder then there\u2019s medication for that right? Something that could maybe stop the attacks for good?",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that really what you want, Sam?",
        "Sam: What do you mean? Of course it is. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you\u2019re telling me that, if you could, you would get rid of this ability all together? You would give up the chance to travel through time and see such amazing things? ",
        "Sam: I- I think so? I mean, if it just keeps happening - if I can\u2019t learn to control it, then yes. I can\u2019t live like this anymore. If there\u2019s a way out, I want it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t think medication is the answer in your case. And besides, I am not an MD. I can\u2019t prescribe you anything. ",
        "Sam: But I could go see someone else right? I could go to a psychiatrist and just tell them I have panic attacks and get something to get rid of them?",
        "Dr. Bright: Is this why you came back to see me, Sam? To get medication?",
        "Sam: No, no- I mean, maybe but not entirely. I really did want someone to talk to but I just - I thought maybe there would be some sort of drug that might help. I mean, modern medicine has come so far right? And I was looking up some stuff online and there are plenty of drugs now that deal with pretty serious conditions.",
        "Dr. Bright: While that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t think it applies here. You time travel, Sam. Your body bends both space and time on a regular basis. That\u2019s a little outside the realm of modern medicine. There\u2019s no way of knowing what a serious psychotropic drug would do to you.",
        "Sam: So there\u2019s nothing you can do after all. I just have to stay this way forever. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not saying that. You have an incredible gift and I think you can learn to harness it. If we can get to the root of your anxiety, maybe you can learn to expect your panic attacks and prevent or even focus them on a specific time and place. ",
        "Sam: You really think I could learn to control it?",
        "Dr. Bright: With my help, I think that\u2019s a distinct possibility, yes. But you have to be committed - you need to be open to what I tell you and make sure that you answer all my questions honestly and fully. We\u2019re entering foreign territory, Sam. But that doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. Think of it as embarking on a new adventure. ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m a little tired of new adventures - I thought that would have been obvious by now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. I know you must be frustrated, but this is progress. A week ago you were dealing with this alone, which, by what you\u2019ve told me, meant not really dealing with it at all. But now I\u2019m here to help you. You need to trust me, Sam. You don\u2019t need to do this alone anymore.",
        "Sam: Okay. Okay, I guess - I guess you\u2019re right. I suppose I could - I could try. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Good. That\u2019s good. See? I think you\u2019re doing better already. Being open about your ability will make all the difference in the world. ",
        "Sam: You don\u2019t mean I should go out and tell people about it do you? Because, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that yet, and who would I talk to exactly? I don\u2019t have a lot of people in my life for obvious reasons and I-",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, Sam, it\u2019s alright - breathe. I didn\u2019t mean you should be talking about this with other people. I\u2019m sorry I should have made that clear. Obviously, it would be foolish to make your ability any more public than it is. (stern) You cannot tell anyone else about this.  ",
        "Sam: No, of course not. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you can talk to me. You can tell me everything you remember - all the stories you\u2019ve been keeping inside all these years. And you should. It will help me help you if I know as much as I can about your condition. ",
        "Sam: Okay. I think I can do that. What do you want to know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Tell me about your first trip. Ancient Greece, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: Ha, yeah, it was Ancient Greece. Well, first of all, I was so confused - I mean, one moment I\u2019m lying on my bed reading and the next, I\u2019m lying in a field and I get up and look around...",

        "Dr. Bright: Well, Sam, I am so pleased that you came back. Start trying those calming methods every day as I taught you and consider the journal idea. ",
        "Sam: You really think it will help to write all my trips down? Isn\u2019t that a little dangerous? What if someone finds it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Even if someone did, they would most likely think it a work of fiction. But yes, I do think it will help. If you bring me copies of what you write down, I can read through them and see if I can spot any patterns. We may find something helpful.  ",
        "Sam: Alright, I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Bright. Really, I- this- well. It means a lot. What you\u2019re doing for me. I had forgotten what it could be like - I mean, I haven\u2019t thought about that first trip to Greece in so long. I forgot how wonderful it was at first. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It can be like that again, Sam. You can learn to control it. I have faith in you. ",
        "Sam: Thank you. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Successful first full session. While the patient was at first reluctant to embrace her ability, I think we will be able to harness it. Her travels have been quite impressive - she\u2019s traveled much farther back in time than I would have expected, and to such different geographic locations, that I\u2019m beginning to think her range is limitless. Whether or not she is able to become fully corporeal when traveling back remains to be seen. The things that could be possible...I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, but I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t immediately think of Mark when she said she could time travel. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. She\u2019s still holding back so much - if I can get her to trust me without spooking her, I think she could be the biggest asset I have. ",

        "Dr. Bright: You missed him. ",
        "Caleb: No, I didn\u2019t miss him. It just- you know, he simplified things, I guess. Made it easier to breathe. Even if he\u2019s like, so fucking sad all the time. Or he was. He\u2019s been a little better this week. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I take it you talked to him like I asked?",

        "Caleb: Well, I was all ready on Monday to do what you said. To talk to him and maybe see if he wanted to eat lunch together, or whatever.  I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m responsible for him or anything, but of all the ideas you\u2019ve had, it\u2019s one of the less head-shrink-y ones. The guy really does feel like he could use a friend. I guess it might as well be me, you know? ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad you feel that way, Caleb. You\u2019re a very caring boy and you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to let people see that. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, sure, whatever. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But it went badly? Did he say no?",
        "Caleb: No, he didn\u2019t get a chance to. I walked into class and he was sitting there listening to his Snow Patrol or whatever the fuck it is he listens to. And he was feeling really- really...ugh, I don\u2019t know. Like...like, sad but calm? I don\u2019t know. It was like, lonely but sort of resigned to it. Like, I felt alone but it didn\u2019t hurt really. It was just kind of this quiet sadness, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand that. Sometimes being alone can be nice. We can be content in being a little lonely. ",
        "Caleb: Sure, yeah, I guess so. The music was soothing him a bit I think. So maybe he wasn\u2019t listening to Snow Patrol then. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What happened next?",
        "Caleb: Well, I was just sort of standing there and looking at him. Just adjusting to the feelings, you know? And then he looks up at me so I start walking towards him and then I start feeling really nervous and like, really hot. Like, temperature hot.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d be nervous to talk to him. It can be hard making new friends. ",
        "Caleb: No, it wasn\u2019t me. I mean, sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell, but these feelings were definitely someone else\u2019s.",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you know?",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t fit into my body. Usually, it\u2019s either that the feelings are all just jumbled up, like in most of my classes, when there are a bunch of different people feeling a bunch of different things. And then sometimes, it just takes over and kind of finds, like a, like a home in my chest. Like with Adam. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean it finds a home?",
        "Caleb: Well...I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like...when I\u2019m around him, whatever he\u2019s feeling just sort of settles into me and sits there. Next to my own feelings. Like, his sadness, or whatever, becomes my sadness. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Does that happen with anyone else when you\u2019re one on one with them? ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess. Like, when my mom is worried, I feel worried. And I know it\u2019s hers but I also feel like it\u2019s mine a bit. It\u2019s got a different color to it from my own, but sometimes the edges blur together and it creates a new kind of color. Does that make sense?",
        "Dr. Bright: It does. So, for example, if your emotions are yellow and Adam\u2019s are blue, you get green. ",
        "Caleb: Right, yeah. Yeah, and with him, it\u2019s like everything becomes green. Whereas with someone else, it\u2019s a lot of yellow and a lot of blue and then a little bit of green between them. God, this is a fucking stupid way of talking about things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No it isn\u2019t. In all my years as a psychologist, I have yet to discover a perfect way to talk about emotions. Visualizing them can be very helpful.  So with Adam it completely blurs together? You can\u2019t tell the difference between his emotions and yours?",
        "Caleb: Not exactly. I mean, sometimes he\u2019s blue, and he stays blue. But yeah, sometimes, his feelings make green and I know that they\u2019re his feelings but they feel real to me. Like more real than other people\u2019s. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And he is the only person you\u2019ve encountered that has this particular effect on you?",
        "Caleb: Uh, yeah. I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Interesting. I wonder what the reason for that is. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you and me both. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure the more you spend time with him, the more you\u2019ll grow to understand whatever connection is there. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, maybe. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But let\u2019s get back on task. You were saying you started to feel nervous and hot when approaching Adam?",
        "Caleb: Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, and he was looking at me and I was about to say something \u2018cause I was just standing there like an idiot and then this girl in our class, Caitlin, started talking to me and the nervous feeling got worse. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was it Caitlin who was feeling nervous?",
        "Caleb: Uh, yeah, I think so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what did she say to you?",
        "Caleb: Um, she...um, she, uh, she asked me to this stupid dance at school. It\u2019s a Sadie Hawkins dance? You know, when the girls ask the boys?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m familiar with the tradition. ",
        "Caleb: So, yeah, well, she asked me to that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what did you say?",
        "Caleb: I said yes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t sound very excited about that. Do you not like this Caitlin girl?",
        "Caleb: No, I mean, she\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just...I didn\u2019t really like her feelings. Or, at least, I think they were her feelings. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The hot, nervous feelings you mean?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it just got worse the longer we talked. It made me feel like, prickly and just like, I don't know, fucking weird. My skin felt like it was burning up, like I had a sunburn or something.",
        "Dr. Bright: And have you ever felt this way before?",
        "Caleb: Uh, yeah, I guess so. But never this strongly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been talking to the person while they\u2019ve been feeling that way. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what do you think it is?",
        "Caleb: Um, I\u2019m not sure. I guess she was nervous to ask me. I get that. I mean, I was already sort of nervous myself so that didn\u2019t bother me so much. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What were you nervous about? Talking to Adam?",
        "Caleb: Um, yeah, I guess so. I mean, it didn\u2019t go so well last time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So Caitlin\u2019s nerves didn\u2019t bother you. But you said you didn\u2019t like her feelings? What did you mean?",
        "Caleb: It was the other stuff. The tingly, nauseous feeling. Or, not nauseous, really, but...",
        "Dr. Bright: Butterflies?",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: Did it feel like butterflies in your stomach?",
        "Caleb: Uh, yeah, it did. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds like she likes you. ",
        "Caleb: What, you mean like like-likes me?",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you disagree?",
        "Caleb: No, I guess not. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re sixteen, Caleb:. Haven\u2019t you felt that way yourself before?",
        "Caleb: Um, not really. Not in a long time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Really? That\u2019s alright, you know. You don\u2019t have to want romance or sex. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know that. But it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just...I haven\u2019t been able to talk to another person and feel my own feelings enough to notice. And, to be, like, totally honest, I\u2019ve sort of avoided girls for the past few years. Their emotions are so much bigger and...ugh, they\u2019re just harder to deal with. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. So, feeling this lust from Caitlin-",
        "Caleb: Ick, no, can we not call it that? That\u2019s just- that's weird. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. Feeling this...attraction must have been surprising. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it was. I mean, I guess she basically asked me on a date, so maybe it shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise but yeah, it still felt wicked strange. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And do you find Caitlin attractive in return?",
        "Caleb: Um, she\u2019s okay. Yeah, she\u2019s pretty. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t sound very convinced. ",
        "Caleb: I just meant that, yeah, I can see that she\u2019s pretty but...",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019re not attracted to her. ",
        "Caleb: No, I\u2019m not. I shouldn\u2019t have said yes, should I?",
        "Dr. Bright: Not necessarily. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t go to a dance with someone as friends. ",
        "Caleb: I know but...I knew she liked me - like, somewhere, in the back of my mind, I knew that - and that I didn\u2019t feel the same way but I said yes anyway. Isn\u2019t that leading her on? Shouldn\u2019t I have just been, like, honest?",
        "Dr. Bright: Ideally. But it\u2019s not always that easy. There are plenty of adults who would have done the exact same thing. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So I take it you didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to Adam after that?",
        "Caleb: Uh, no. I was sort of distracted. And by the time Caitlin sat down, Adam had taken out his notebook and started doodling or whatever it is that he does and it just didn\u2019t seem like a good time to talk to him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was that a feeling you were getting from him?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, he was mad. And like, bummed about something. I don\u2019t know, he just didn\u2019t seem super approachable right then.",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you try again later?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, on Wednesday, after class. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how did that go?",
        "Caleb: It went fine. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Come on, Caleb. You\u2019ve been on a roll so far this session. Don\u2019t clam up now. ",
        "Caleb: Well, I was nervous again. And he was too. The moment I said his name, he looked up, it was like, instant panic from him. I almost walked away right then. I didn\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: But you didn\u2019t walk away?",
        "Caleb: Nah. Then I would have looked like a total weirdo, just saying his name and then leaving. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So what did you say to him?",
        "Caleb: I told him I liked his presentation on Macbeth and he didn\u2019t say anything. He just sort of stared up at me, still pretty panicked. So I asked him if he wanted to get lunch and he looked at me all funny and said yes. So we went and got lunch. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how did that go?",
        "Caleb: It was...different. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How so?",
        "Caleb: It was...nice. We got stuff from the cafeteria and took it outside - I just told him I didn\u2019t like how loud the cafeteria was and he felt the same way - and it was quiet and...not calm, but...I don\u2019t know, it was nice. ",
        "Dr. Bright: His feelings didn\u2019t overwhelm you?",
        "Caleb: Well, they did, sort of. I mean, I could feel them really strongly - he was nervous and confused and excited - but I was kind of all of those things too and it was just...",
        "Dr. Bright: Green?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. It didn\u2019t rub me up the wrong way like Caitlin\u2019s emotions did. I mean, it was a totally different set of emotions I guess, but they just seemed to fit. Like, I could feel his emotions fine, but I could also feel mine pretty well. And I apologized for shouting at him last week and that made him less nervous and then it was just...I don't know, it was easy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very pleased to hear that, Caleb. Were you able to control how much of his emotions you were feeling? Balance them out a bit?",
        "Caleb: Um, I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t really try. Sometimes it did it on it\u2019s own - like, it would be softer at times and bigger at other times and...ugh, I don\u2019t know how to describe it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Try a visual comparison again. See if that helps. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but I don\u2019t think the color thing applies. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then try to think of something that does. What else have you encountered in your life that was similar to this experience? ",
        "Caleb: Um...it\u2019s kind of like- it's kind of like the ocean. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The ocean?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you know when you\u2019re standing at the edge of the water and the waves come up the sand to your feet and sometimes there\u2019s, like, a strong wave and your whole leg gets wet? It was sort of like that. The more we were talking, it was like his feelings were the water. I could feel them all the time, but sometimes there would be a big wave and the feeling would sort of cover everything up for a moment and then go back again. But I was always myself, you know? It wasn\u2019t like I ever became the ocean too. I didn\u2019t get washed away.",
        "Dr. Bright: Well. That is quite the analogy. I\u2019m very pleased to hear that further exposure to Adam has made it easier to balance your own emotions with others. I\u2019m curious - the ocean as you describe it is often thought of as a very calm place. Does Adam make you calmer?",
        "Caleb: I guess so. But, I mean, sometimes waves get really big and scary too. Like, when we were talking about the guys who were making fun of him, there was definitely a really big wave of anger that sort of took me under for a second. I got really, really angry too and sort of had to take some deep breaths like you taught me to calm myself down. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And where was your anger directed? I know in the past you\u2019ve had a hard time with other people\u2019s anger. It\u2019s made you want to lash out at the source. Did you get angry at Adam?",
        "Caleb: Uh, no. No, I didn\u2019t. It was- I was angry at those guys. But I was sort of angry with them to begin with. Well, not sort of. Like actually, really fucking angry.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think you would have done something if those boys had come by in that moment?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. I mean, the breathing helped, but, yeah, I mean, I was still pretty mad. But I won\u2019t hit anyone again, I mean, I promise. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you\u2019re trying Caleb, but remember why you\u2019re here. You haven\u2019t been handling your anger - or the anger of others - particularly well. I\u2019m happy to hear that the breathing is helping you, but we still have a long way to go on that front. ",
        "Caleb: I know. But that was ages ago. I didn\u2019t even know what was going on at that point, that I was feeling other people\u2019s feelings. I\u2019m not dangerous, I promise. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you\u2019re not dangerous, Caleb. You\u2019re a very kind boy. You would never hurt someone intentionally, I know that. ",
        "Caleb: But you think sometimes other people\u2019s feelings get the better of me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I do. Why don\u2019t we take a break from the talk for a bit, work on those breathing exercises?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, yeah, okay. ",

        "Chloe: Well, this week wasn't so great, to be honest. I followed your advice at first - staying away from large groups - but that just didn\u2019t work. I like being where there are lots of people around and it didn\u2019t feel right being cooped up in my house with just me and my mom. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were the voices a little better when you were at home at least?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, they were. Things were pretty quiet. And the longer I stayed inside, the quieter they would get. And I didn\u2019t like that very much. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why not? I would have thought that would be a relief. ",
        "Chloe: I mean, it was sort of nice at first, being able to listen to the sounds around me rather than the angels. But, then it just became lonely. My art suffered. I didn\u2019t realize how much inspiration the angels were giving me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean by that? How were they giving you inspiration?",
        "Chloe: Well, they would tell me things - and sometimes show me things - like these bright, strong flashes of emotion and feeling and I...I just started to put it into my art. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They show you things?",
        "Chloe: In their way. I don\u2019t really know how to explain it. They don\u2019t send me clear images but I still sort of see something in my mind. Does that make sense? As if, when they speak to me, what they\u2019re saying sort of becomes my own thoughts, you know? Like I\u2019m picturing it in my own head or something. I\u2019m sorry, that probably doesn\u2019t explain it very well. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s alright. We\u2019re in completely new territory. The transfer of thoughts from one consciousness to another is bound to be confusing business. ",
        "Chloe: And you still think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening? That I\u2019m hearing other people\u2019s thoughts?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think that it\u2019s the most logical explanation. ",
        "Chloe: If you say so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But back to your interesting encounter - what happened on your way here?",
        "Chloe: Oh right! Well, I was walking to the bus stop from my house and I passed this homeless man sitting by the bank. And well, I don\u2019t know if he was new to the area or if I\u2019ve just never seen him before - I hope it\u2019s not that, I hope that I haven\u2019t just been ignoring him - but today, it was like...it was like the angels went out of their way to get me to notice him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you mean?",
        "Chloe: Well, as I was walking past, I got all of these voices and images bombarding me all at once. It\u2019s not usually like that - it\u2019s not usually so- so...overwhelming. And there were other people on the street but I knew, I just knew, that it was all about this man. I mean, he wasn\u2019t even doing anything - just huddled on the ground humming to himself. But the angels wanted me to pay attention to him I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, I want you to try something with me. Instead of referring to these voices as angels speaking to you, I want you to talk about them like they are thoughts from other people. I know you\u2019re skeptical about that theory, but I want you to just try thinking about it that way and see how you feel, okay? Can you do that?",
        "Chloe: I think so. Yes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Good. So all these thoughts and images were coming from one man?",
        "Chloe: Yes. Frank is his name I think. Or, it\u2019s his name sometimes? That was a little unclear. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, let\u2019s just call him Frank for now. ",
        "Chloe: Okay.",
        "Dr. Bright: So what was it about Frank\u2019s thoughts that were so different to you?",
        "Chloe: Well, a lot of time the voices- sorry, the thoughts - are really scattered and confusing because it\u2019s a lot of different thoughts at once. But this - this was like being in a big crowd and hearing a lot of overlapping thoughts but it was all from one person. It was all in the same voice. And it was talking about so many different things. Or I guess, he was thinking about so many different things. Oh god, his is confusing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know, that\u2019s okay, Chloe. The more you talk about it in this way, the more it will make sense. But like I said, this is new territory - it\u2019s going to be frustrating at first. ",
        "Chloe: Right. So, anyway, it was the normal confusing swirl of thoughts but all from the same source. Like, they all had the same color to them - the same taste. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, in our first session, you talked about voices almost exclusively. And yet today, you speak of images, taste, and color. Has something changed in the way you\u2019re hearing things?",
        "Chloe: No, not too much. I didn\u2019t mention the other things before because they aren\u2019t always there. I always hear things, but sometimes other things come with them - it can be a full sensory experience. But it\u2019s only like that with really intense thoughts - like if someone is angry, or sad, or something. I guess...I guess it\u2019s their emotions isn\u2019t it? Not just their thoughts, but how they feel about it too?",
        "Dr. Bright: Very good, Chloe. I think you\u2019re probably right. For instance, when you heard your mother thinking about her other child - the one who passed away - did you get any images or other feelings?",
        "Chloe: A little, I guess. It wasn\u2019t really strong though - I mean, I guess my mom wasn\u2019t really actively thinking about her, you know? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Right. It was more of a subconscious thought than anything else.",
        "Chloe: Sure, yeah. It was like...like, this dull ache. And it was gray and hungry. Ugh, that\u2019s not a good descriptor. I wasn\u2019t really paying attention to the feeling of it. The information was so surprising that I couldn\u2019t focus on anything else. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure. How exactly does the information get to you? You\u2019ve said the voices \u201ctell you\u201d. Was it your mother\u2019s voice talking about her child in your head or was it someone else\u2019s?",
        "Chloe: Umm...I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019ve never thought about it like that. It\u2019s not really like being told - not like how you say something out loud to another person and they hear you. It\u2019s more that...I just know. There\u2019s a voice - it\u2019s not mine, it\u2019s not really identifiable at all - but it speaks and even though I can\u2019t pick out the words, I know what it\u2019s saying. God, that sounds crazy. Maybe I really am a schizo after all. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, Chloe, I don\u2019t think you are. It doesn\u2019t sound crazy. Think about it: when you have thoughts, they are often unclear and unstructured, but your mind is still processing them. I imagine it\u2019s just the same with hearing other\u2019s thoughts. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I guess so. God, my head hurts.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know this is overwhelming. But we first need to understand how and what is happening before we- before you can learn to control it. ",
        "Chloe: And you really think I can learn to control it? To turn it off and on?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not certain, but I\u2019m very hopeful. But let\u2019s go back to your encounter with Frank. You were saying how you were getting everything at once - thoughts, images, colors...is that right?",
        "Chloe: Yes, yeah, and that\u2019s never happened before. It\u2019s never been every single sense. And usually people are thinking about a couple of things at once but I guess, well I guess people\u2019s moods kind of affect what they think about, so it\u2019s usually all the same kind of stuff that a person is thinking about. But this - this was so many different things. Angry thoughts, sad thoughts, happy thoughts, all of it at once. And I couldn\u2019t really get a grip on any of them. One second he was thinking about fighting in the war - not sure which one, I never got a clear thought about that - and then the next he was thinking about his father. I can\u2019t be sure, but I think he might be dead. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Mental illness is often seen in the homeless population - it\u2019s very possible Frank is suffering some mental health issues and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the erratic thought behavior. Particularly given his history as a veteran, if that\u2019s what he is. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, he was definitely in the military for a little while. But that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not all he is. He\u2019s an artist. He\u2019s an incredible artist.",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Chloe: Because I saw it. That\u2019s what most of thoughts were. Between the violence and the sadness and the loneliness, there were some of the most wonderful paintings I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t know how many of them were real and how many of them were only in his head, but they were breathtaking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That sounds lovely. ",
        "Chloe: Oh, it was. But he\u2019s still homeless isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s cold and hungry and he has beautiful art to make and no opportunity to. I want to help him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you do. But you have to be careful. You need to focus on your own health right now. You can\u2019t get distracted with someone else\u2019s problems when trying to fix your own. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m not trying to fix anything. Not myself or Frank. Neither of us are sick, we\u2019re just...confused. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I apologize, I wasn\u2019t trying to suggest that you need fixing. But you are dealing with a really big life change right now, Chloe:, and I don\u2019t want you taking on more responsibility than you can handle. ",
        "Chloe: I know that. I just- his art needs to be seen by people. He needs to paint. I think- I think he would feel better if he could paint. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you talk to him at all?",
        "Chloe: No. I was- it was too much to process all at once and I had to come here, but I want to. I was hoping to talk to him on my way home. Maybe bring him some food. He looked so skinny. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Your mother mentioned this about you - always trying to make the world a more beautiful and better place. That\u2019s a wonderful quality, Chloe. And I think you could do a lot of good with your ability if you knew how to control it. Think of all the beauty you could see and spread around if you could read minds at will.  ",
        "Chloe: But how do I do that? How on earth am I supposed to learn how to read people\u2019s minds?",
        "Dr. Bright: Reading minds doesn\u2019t seem to be your problem. It\u2019s more a matter of whose and when. I\u2019d like to go through some meditation exercises with you...",

        "Dr. Bright: Hello, Sam. It\u2019s good to see you. How are you feeling today?",
        "[sfx: closing door]",
        "Sam: Hi, Dr. Bright. Um, I\u2019m doing well. Another trip free week! ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad to hear it. But remember Sam, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gone forever. While I\u2019m pleased with your progress, this isn\u2019t something you can get over in just a few weeks. ",
        "Sam: I know. But I\u2019m enjoying the break while it lasts. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. I know that many of your trips have been challenging - much of history is very unpleasant. Do you think you could tell me about them?",
        "Sam: I mean, it\u2019s really the amount of time spent away that\u2019s difficult.",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you mean? Most of the trips you\u2019ve told me about so far have been a day at the most. ",
        "Sam: Right, yeah, I mean, that\u2019s how they started out. But after- well, when I was sixteen, they, um, they started getting longer. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And less pleasant?",
        "Sam: Ha, yeah, I guess- I guess you could say that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Could you tell me about it? What was the first long trip that you took?",
        "Sam: Um, it was, well, it was a few months after that trip to the French court that I told you about? And that one was just half a day, like so many others, but this- uh, this was the first trip that was longer than a day. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How long was it?",
        "Sam: Um, I\u2019m not exactly sure? Three weeks? Maybe a month, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Dr. Bright: A month? That\u2019s quite a dramatic shift - one day to one month. ",
        "Sam: I know, trust me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And the amount of time that passed in your own life? Were you still gone for only a few minutes?",
        "Sam: Um, yeah, I think so. It\u2019s a little different every time, but I don\u2019t think it was longer than 30 minutes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So, one month. Where did you go?",
        "Sam: I\u2019m- I\u2019m not sure exactly. Somewhere in Europe, it was hard to tell. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you in the countryside? No people, no landmarks?",
        "Sam: Uh, no, no there were people around. It was- I think it was World War I? I mean, the uniforms looked like it was maybe World War I, and then there was the whole trench thing, so yeah, I think that\u2019s where I was. I mean, I never got any confirmation, but it\u2019s not like they exactly called it World War I at the time. I mean, particularly, when, you know, fighting it. Not that that would have helped if they did. Because, um, well, I don\u2019t speak any German so, I didn\u2019t really know what any of them were talking about. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You were in the trenches of World War I for four weeks?",
        "Sam: Um, yeah, yeah I guess so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you were how old? Sixteen?",
        "Sam: Yeah, somewhere around there. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I\u2019m - I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t even imagine what that must have been like. To be so young and see what you must have seen. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s, um, something I\u2019ve tried to not think too much about since it happened. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. But I think it would be good for you to tell me about it.",
        "Sam: Why? I mean, what can we possibly learn from it? I don\u2019t understand why I need to talk about every single trip I ever took! I mean, it\u2019s always the same - I\u2019m just stuck there, not able to talk to anyone, not able to really change anything. It doesn\u2019t matter where I am. None of it\u2019s real - it\u2019s like, just, dreaming or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But it\u2019s not a dream. And even though a month didn\u2019t pass in your real life, you still spent that amount of time in what I imagine was a horrific war zone. That matters quite a lot. It must have been very traumatizing. ",
        "Sam: Of course it was traumatizing! But a lot of the trips have been traumatizing. At least I know I can\u2019t get hurt. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you saw other people get hurt, didn\u2019t you?",
        "Sam: Yeah, I did. I mean, of course I did. It was a war. One of the worst wars in history. And it\u2019s just like history class teaches you - absolutely brutal. The smell of the trenches, the mustard gas, all those bodies. Some of the men in the trenches were even my age! Boys, I guess, not men. And they all died. Every single one. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m so sorry, Sam. I can only guess at the lasting effects something like that has had on you. The horrors that you witnessed, the carnage - you must have been completely terrified. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, yeah I was. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Talk to me about it. Tell me about what you saw. ",
        "Sam: Why? I don\u2019t exactly want to relive the whole thing right now, do I? Out of all the trips, it was one of the worst, especially since it was after- it was just really, really bad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Especially since it was after what?",
        "Sam: After- after such a nice trip. The one before it I mean - it was just a big shock, that\u2019s all. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I should think so. That is a very big shift for your trips to take - do you think there was a reason for the change?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t control anything about them, you know that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. But it seems as if your earlier trips were mostly harmless - sometimes downright enjoyable - and as you grew older, you started to travel to more upsetting places. Is that an accurate summation?",
        "Sam: I suppose so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So what caused it? I don\u2019t think it was simple puberty and hormones that did it. ",
        "Sam: Why not?",
        "Dr. Bright: Growing up is a part of human life in the same way that your condition is a part of you. They should have worked in harmony. It seems more likely to me that the shift would have been caused by a shock to your system. Was there anything out of the ordinary that happened in that time? A big injury? A major life change?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know - I mean, when you\u2019re sixteen, everything seems pretty major, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam. You know the difference. Did anything traumatic happen to you during that time? First broken heart, perhaps?",
        "Sam: Ha, if only.",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, it\u2019s alright. You can tell me. ",
        "Sam: But, I\u2019ve never- I\u2019ve never told anyone. I- I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too...",
        "Dr. Bright: Too much?",
        "Sam: Yes, yeah, it\u2019s too much. I don\u2019t want to leave again. It\u2019s been so good these past few weeks. Don\u2019t make me leave again. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me, Sam. Remember, even if you start to panic and you leave, you will come back. And I will be right here for you.  ",
        "Sam: You can\u2019t tell anyone. Please. I\u2019m- it was all my fault and I\u2019ve never told anyone. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What was your fault, Sam? What happened when you were sixteen?",
        "Sam: I was in the car with my parents. They were teaching me how to drive. I\u2019d been so reluctant to drive the car anywhere but the parking lot where my dad had been teaching me - the road made me so nervous, driving is so dangerous - and they thought if they both came along, I\u2019d be calmer about it. But I wasn\u2019t. I was driving along the main road, my dad in the back, my mom in the passenger seat, and there were so many cars around, and we were approaching a big intersection and I started to panic, and I think I was yelling to my parents to stop the car because I- I couldn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know what to do, and they were trying to calm me down because they didn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t understand I couldn\u2019t calm down, that I couldn\u2019t control what was about to happen and then- then I went away. I don\u2019t even remember where I went or how long I was gone. But when I came back- when I came back I was in the middle of the road and in front of me in front of me was a huge truck. And it- it had slammed into the car. And my parents - they were dead. My mom had climbed into the driver\u2019s seat to try and drive and if she hadn\u2019t- they were both dead. I killed them.",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam. What happened was an accident. A horrible accident, but an accident nonetheless. You didn\u2019t kill your parents. ",
        "Sam: Of course I did! I knew what might happen to me - I knew that driving made me nervous, and I got into the car anyway. I was driving the car, with my parents in it, knowing that I might disappear at any moment. I did that - I killed them. I yelled at them and then I went away and when I came back, they were dead.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, breathe-",
        "Sam: And everyone was saying to me how terrible it was, how tragic, but how lucky that I was thrown from the car, that I lived. How it\u2019s what my parents would have wanted - for me to live. Everyone comforting me, pitying me, crying for me, and they didn\u2019t know- they didn\u2019t know that it was my fault. That my parents would still be alive if I wasn\u2019t who I was, if they\u2019d just had a daughter who was normal-",

        "Dr. Bright: Patient has disappeared in the same manner as our first session. She grew pale and shaky - though this time she seemed oblivious to the symptoms, which is very atypical for her as I understand it - and then her body flickered for a moment, before she disappeared completely. I must admit, as much as I wanted to observe one of her trips, I wasn\u2019t quite expecting all this. I\u2019m surprised that talking about her visit to the trenches didn\u2019t induce panic - possibly a positive sign about her progress. But this trauma with her parents will continue to hold her back if we don\u2019t- this is interesting. The air around where Sam: was sitting is beginning to shimmer.

I don\u2019t want to keep going away. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. I was feeling good today and you made me disappear. Why would you do that? Aren\u2019t you supposed to make me feel better?",

Just thinking about our conversation - you asking me about the bad stuff, the trenches, my teenage trauma. I get it, I do. You\u2019ve seen a lot of strange things in your day, you\u2019ve said, but never someone like me. Why not watch the freak do what she does best, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, it\u2019s important for me to observe your condition in order to understand it better. You can\u2019t hide from it forever. ",
        "Sam: Right. Of course. Because then I won\u2019t be able to control it. But why would I want to control it? I want it to go away. I don\u2019t care about traveling through time - I\u2019ve done enough of that for 100 lifetimes. I just want to have a normal life. Why won\u2019t you help me with that? Why do you insist that I learn to control it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because I think it\u2019s important, Sam. This isn\u2019t like you to be angry. You\u2019ve just come back from a trip - you\u2019re not in the proper mindset right now. ",
        "Sam: My mindset is fine! There was no one around where I went. Just me and time to think. And if you won\u2019t help me get rid of this, if you\u2019ll just make me relive all the worst things that have ever happened to me, then, then I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. ",

He expressed having great difficulty at his school\u2019s Sadie Hawkins dance and almost got into an altercation with another student who was frightening his date.

And she was really scared and he was acting, like, really fucking aggressive - I mean, anyone could see that, you didn\u2019t need to be me to know that - and so I pushed him away and he tried to hit me and then the chaperones got there, okay?",

I mean, normally adults are easier, but I had just had lunch with Adam and I felt good and normal for once, so I wasn\u2019t really paying attention and he just sort of got the better of me.  Sometimes it\u2019s just fucking hard to keep everything in. ",
        "Dr. Bright:I know. It\u2019s okay to slip up now and then. Nobody\u2019s perfect. But tell me: do you think you would have had the same problem if Adam had been in the principal\u2019s office with you?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you tried hanging out with Adam in a group setting? I think it\u2019s worth seeing how he affects you when other people are around. ",
        "Caleb: I mean, we still have class together. And he still drowns out everyone else for the most part. Except now he\u2019s calmer, more focused.  Well, and some- sometimes...",
        "Dr. Bright: Sometimes?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I feel that- sometimes I feel that butterfly feeling that we were talking about a few weeks ago. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you think it\u2019s coming from Adam? Caitlin is in the same class, isn\u2019t she?",
        "Caleb:Yeah, but after the whole Sadie Hawkins disaster, she hardly pays attention to me. No, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s coming from him. I mean, I\u2019ve gotten used to the way his feelings feel. The butterflies don\u2019t bother me the way they do from other people. It feels kind of...nice. But I don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s about. I don\u2019t know what he has to be nervous about. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you only feel it when you\u2019re in class together?",
        "Caleb: Um, no. No, it happens other times too. Like when we\u2019re eating lunch or studying or...it\u2019s actually pretty random. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what is Adam doing when you start feeling this butterfly feeling?",
        "Caleb: Um...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve- I don't know if I've ever really noticed. There doesn\u2019t really seem to be a pattern - it just sort of happens. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Hm. And do you ever get nervous yourself when you\u2019re with him?",
        "Caleb: Um...yeah, I guess so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why is that?",
        "Caleb: Well, I don\u2019t know, I guess I\u2019m still not totally sure if he likes being my friend. Like, it just sort of happened really quickly and we\u2019ve never really talked about it. So I guess sometimes I get nervous asking him to hang out or whatever. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Because you think he\u2019ll say no?",
        "Caleb: Right. Like, this past week, I asked if he wanted to come watch me play football. And Adam doesn\u2019t really like sports so I sort of thought he\u2019d say no. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But he didn\u2019t?",
        "Caleb: No, he said yes.",
        "Dr. Bright: But you were nervous to ask him? ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, like, really fucking nervous. And then I was nervous when he came to the game. And it just- it was so weird because, normally, all I can feel on the field is the focus and the aggression of my teammates. And sometimes the nerves of the other team. That\u2019s actually how I know if they\u2019re about to make a risky play.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, please don\u2019t tell me you use your ability to cheat in football. ",
        "Caleb: No, no of course not. I mean, I can\u2019t really. It\u2019s not like I can read their minds and see the plays. I can just tell when I should be paying extra attention. But God, can you imagine if I could see the plays? That would be awesome. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You were saying you were nervous when Adam came to the game?",
        "Caleb: Yeah and so was he. That\u2019s the weird thing - I could feel him over the whole team. I could feel how nervous he was. But it was really strange, \u2018cause he was nervous for me. Like, it was his emotion but it almost felt like mine because it was aimed at me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you know why was he nervous for you?",
        "Caleb: I think he was worried I would get hurt. He thinks football is \u201ca barbaric game for idiots who can\u2019t afford to lose more brain cells\u201d. His words not mine. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see why were you nervous to invite him. ",
        "Caleb: Ha, yeah, exactly. But I think- I really think he had a really good time. Once I started playing, it\u2019s like...like he was in awe of me or something. Like he thought I was really impressive. Almost like- almost like he was proud of me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That must have felt wonderful. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it did. And I think- I think that\u2019s what helped me win the game. It\u2019s like he was there with me, rooting me on or something.",
        "Dr. Bright: His faith in you was encouraging. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s it exactly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds like the two of you have quite a connection. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess we do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What happened after the game? Adam must have been happy that you won.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, he was! He ran up to me, and he was smiling like I\u2019ve never seen him smile before and it felt...I don\u2019t know, it felt like I was on the top of the world. And I couldn\u2019t really tell who was feeling happy - if it was him, or me, or both of us - but, I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t really matter. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was the butterfly feeling back?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Why? ",
        "Dr. Bright: The only other time you\u2019ve talked about that feeling, it was with Caitlin, whom you admitted wanted to date you. Do you think it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s the same for Adam?",
        "Caleb: What? No, no we\u2019re friends. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You know, Caleb, it\u2019s okay if you and Adam like each other in that way, it\u2019s perfectly-",
        "Caleb: I know it\u2019s okay. But, it\u2019s just. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a friend like this. Not really. I don\u2019t want to fuck that up with a bunch of other stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. It\u2019s a lot to process. ",
        "Caleb: And like, he might not even feel that way. I mean, I\u2019m still getting to know him and getting used to his feelings so who knows what he\u2019s thinking when he gets all nervous like that. I mean, I\u2019m still trying to figure out what feelings are even mine and I don\u2019t want to-I don\u2019t want to-",
        "Dr. Bright: Overwhelm it. ",
        "Caleb:  Yeah. It\u2019s a little- it's too much to handle. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t thought- or that he\u2019s not- I just can\u2019t- I can't really think about that right now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand, Caleb. And you don\u2019t have to. You and Adam don\u2019t have to be anything more than what you are now if both of you don\u2019t want that. It just sounded like maybe that\u2019s what you were thinking about. ",
        "Caleb: I really hadn\u2019t thought about it all that much. I was just getting used to actually liking someone enough to spend time with them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. ",
        "Caleb: Can we- can we maybe do some meditation or something? I- I don\u2019t know if I feel like talking anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sure.",

        "Dr. Bright: Alright, Caleb, our time\u2019s up. Don\u2019t stress about Adam too much - just focus on getting your own feelings under control as always. You\u2019ve made so much progress and you should be very proud of that. Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, okay, I won\u2019t. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Patient #13-A-3. Session 5. Both the patient and I have continued with our meditation and mindfulness exercises with moderate success so far. I have also made sure to move the patient\u2019s appointments so she does not have contact with any of my other patients. She has reported being able to hear thoughts somewhat more clearly, which was demonstrated last session when she was able to pinpoint the thoughts of the lawyer in the office above mine. Progress to be certain. But I am hoping we can move forward more rapidly from here so that she might be useful in a few months when-",

        "Chloe: Hi, Dr. Bright! Sorry, I know I\u2019m a few minutes early. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s alright, Chloe, come and take a seat. ",
        "[sfx: Chloe sitting]",
        "Dr. Bright: How was your week?",
        "Chloe: It was good! Great, actually. I finally talked to Frank! ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, I thought we decided that Frank was a distraction. That you were going to focus on learning to control your ability better. ",
        "Chloe: I know, I know, but he\u2019s not a distraction. Really. I just had to say something.  Every time I walk past him - which is a few times a day, to be honest I\u2019ve started just taking walks around the neighborhood to see him - but every time in the past two weeks he\u2019s been thinking about his paintings. And at first it was paintings he had already done - ages ago, before he joined the marines - but in the past few days, it\u2019s been about projects he hasn\u2019t done yet, projects he wants to do. And they\u2019re amazing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How can you tell the difference? Between paintings he\u2019s already done and paintings he has yet to create?",
        "Chloe: Oh, well, I don\u2019t know. I just can. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So he is thinking about them in that way? Dividing the two categories in his own thoughts? ",
        "Chloe: No, not exactly. It\u2019s not what he\u2019s thinking about as much as how he\u2019s thinking about them. I don\u2019t know, maybe I understand better because I\u2019m an artist too? I know how I think about something I\u2019ve already made versus something I want to make and...yeah, that\u2019s the difference I guess. The thoughts take a different shape in his mind. ",
        "Dr. Bright: A different shape? So it isn\u2019t a difference in color or taste or feeling like you\u2019ve described before, but a shape?",
        "Chloe: Mm, I guess shape maybe isn\u2019t the right word? More like a path? Remember how last session I said that it was easier to figure out whose thoughts I was hearing if I held onto it and followed it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, the literal train of thought. ",
        "Chloe: Yes, exactly. It\u2019s sort of like that. Like a thought has to start somewhere and then it follows a path until it turns into something else. So when Frank is thinking about something he wants to paint - or when I\u2019m thinking about what I want to sculpt - it\u2019s coming from a different place than if we were thinking about art we\u2019d already made. So I can tell the difference because they\u2019re following different paths - creating different shapes. Does that make sense? I thought I was getting better at describing these things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, that makes sense. And you are getting better at explaining the processes. You\u2019ve come very far in the past five weeks. We\u2019re pioneering a very ambiguous and subtle new field - the vocabulary isn\u2019t going to be perfect right from the get go. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, you\u2019re right. It is pretty cool isn\u2019t it? Thinking about all the different ways that people think and feel things?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s incredibly cool, Chloe. You are extremely lucky - as far as we know, you\u2019re the only person in the history of the world that has been able to see inside the brain this way. ",
        "Chloe: Ha, no pressure though. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I just meant that you are very unique. And I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re beginning to understand and appreciate that. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I guess I am. I mean, even when it first started, I felt special, you know? Like the angels had picked me to talk to - to tell secrets to. Even though I know it\u2019s not angels now, I still feel that way a bit. That I was chosen for something special. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Maybe you were. I don\u2019t know how much angels have to do with it, but I think you are very special and I think you\u2019ll have the opportunity to do something special with this ability. ",
        "Chloe: Well, that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to Frank! I think I\u2019m meant for him. That my ability is meant for him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Chloe: His paintings! It\u2019s a whole series - seven paintings, enormous oil paintings. And they are breathtaking. I mean, really, really amazing. Like, \u201ccould be in a museum\u201d amazing. And he has no way of painting them. They\u2019re just trapped in his head, trying to get out onto canvas. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry, Chloe, I don\u2019t understand. What does that have to do with you? ",
        "Chloe: I can help him paint them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, this man isn\u2019t your responsibility. Who knows how long he\u2019s been living on the streets - he doesn\u2019t sound stable from what you\u2019ve told me. He could be dangerous. ",
        "Chloe: But he\u2019s not. I would know if he was dangerous. He\u2019s not. Not like that patient of yours-",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, we\u2019ve talked about this. My patients are my business - you have no right to invade their privacy when they\u2019re here seeking counseling. ",
        "Chloe: What do you mean, I have no right? You don\u2019t get to pick and choose who I listen to. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I\u2019m always invading someone\u2019s privacy. I can\u2019t help it and your patients are not off-limits. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry - you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t tell you what to do with your ability - that is entirely up to your own discretion. But for my sake - and professional boundaries - I would prefer it if you did not mention my other patients to me. ",
        "Chloe: Okay. That\u2019s fair. I\u2019m just worried about you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. And that\u2019s very kind of you, but you have nothing to be worried about. Let\u2019s get back to Frank. You said you spoke to him?",
        "Chloe: Yes! And I didn\u2019t really know what to say, so I just gave him a few dollars and thanked him for his service. I know it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a start! And he looked me in the eye - a little confused I think, he probably couldn\u2019t figure out how I knew about his military career - and he said thank you. You know, I figure I can just start saying more and more to him every day and maybe get to know him a bit. Maybe get him to go to the VA or something.",
        "Dr. Bright: Right, you said that he was in the marines?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, for six years. And it really messed him up. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Chloe: Well, I think he\u2019s got that post-trauma thing - the P- the PT-",
        "Dr. Bright: PTSD. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. ",
        "Chloe: Yes, that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s very likely. Many people who have been in a war zone develop some level of PTSD. You\u2019ve mentioned before that you see violence sometimes in his thoughts. Are they images of the war?",
        "Chloe: Yeah. It\u2019s really horrible. Some days are worse than others. I usually try to avoid him on the days he\u2019s thinking about the war. I know that seems cold, but I have the worst nightmares if I listen to him for too long when he\u2019s like that. It\u2019s not easy to get out of your head once you\u2019ve seen it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can imagine. ",
        "Chloe: And it\u2019s hurt him so much. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so confused and angry and scared most of the time. And that\u2019s why he needs to paint. Because when he thinks about his paintings, it\u2019s like he\u2019s almost happy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I still don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re supposed to do about that. Are you planning on buying him the supplies he needs? Provide him the space? Taking responsibility for someone of his situation is a very big undertaking, Chloe. ",
        "Chloe: No, I know that. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m planning to adopt him. I just - I want to help. But getting his paints and canvases wouldn\u2019t be the way, I don\u2019t think. I\u2019m pretty sure he can\u2019t paint anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why not?",
        "Chloe: There\u2019s something wrong with his hands. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an injury or just that he\u2019s - they shake a lot and it frustrates him. Sometimes he just thinks \u201cthese damn hands, these damn hands\u201d over and over and over again. I can hear him thinking about how he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold a brush steady enough to paint. Oh God, that makes him so sad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very sorry to hear that. But I still don\u2019t see how you come into this. ",
        "Chloe: Well...I was thinking I could paint for him. I mean, I can already see what they\u2019re supposed to look like. And it\u2019s not just that - I know what his thought process is behind it so I think I\u2019d be able to mimic his technique. I\u2019m not a painter - it\u2019s never been my strength - but I think I could do it. With him. I think we could make something really beautiful. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well that\u2019s- that\u2019s a very nice idea, Chloe. And actually, I think that could be a very useful exercise for you. A way to really get into someone\u2019s thoughts and put them to use. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah...I guess. That\u2019s sort of an odd way of putting it but, yeah. Yeah, I have this power and maybe this is the something special I\u2019m meant to do?",
        "Dr. Bright: Maybe. At the very least, I think it will help you gain more control. ",
        "Chloe: I think you\u2019re right. Just spending more time around him has definitely made it easier to hear his thoughts more coherently. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve gotten used to the way he thinks so I\u2019m able to pick him out of the crowd better and piece his thoughts together. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That makes sense. He\u2019s become a distinctive voice in your head. ",
        "Chloe: Exactly. Like you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Chloe: Well, the more I come in here, the more I\u2019m able to hear your thoughts. I mean, not like I\u2019m trying to listen. I\u2019m trying to respect your privacy and professional boundaries, and all that. Really. But yeah, every session I\u2019m able to hear a little bit better. You\u2019ve become a distinctive voice too. It\u2019s funny, at first I could barely hear anything from you. It\u2019s like your thoughts were behind this weird fog.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s- that\u2019s probably because my singular focus was you - I wasn\u2019t thinking about much else. I can\u2019t imagine the thoughts of someone actively listening to you would jump out. It would just sound like an echo chamber.",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I guess so. But anyway, now I can hear things a little more clearly. I\u2019ve been able to sift through the fog a little bit. Like, I can hear you\u2019re worried right now. What are you worried about? Is it your patient agai- no, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s me? Why are you worried about me?",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe- ",
        "Chloe: You don\u2019t want me to hear you? Why? I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone anything, I swear. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Please, Chloe, this is counter-productive. Listening to me will not help you.",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m not listening anymore - I\u2019m not trying to anyway. I can\u2019t help it sometimes, you know that. Why are thinking about hiding something from me? What are you hiding from me?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not trying to hide anything from you, Chloe. But I have a lot of sensitive information about other patients and I\u2019m just trying to maintain patient confidentiality.      ",
        "Chloe: No. You\u2019re lying. You don\u2019t care about patient confidentiality. You\u2019ve already broken it. That\u2019s- you just thought that! You\u2019ve told someone about me! ",
        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t. You\u2019re confused, Chloe. You\u2019re getting your wires crossed. ",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t think I am. Who did you tell about me? What are you trying to do?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m trying to help you, Chloe. That\u2019s all I\u2019m ever trying to do. ",
        "Chloe: No, you want to use me for something. I-I don\u2019t understand. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, I promise you. I don\u2019t want to use you for anything. I haven\u2019t told anyone about you. Just my recorder. ",
        "Chloe: Your recorder? You record these sessions?",
        "Dr. Bright: No, no, of course not. I take audio notes about my patients. Their progress, exercises I might want to try. But I am the only one who hears them. No one else knows, I promise. ",
        "Chloe: Then why were you thinking about how pleased someone was going to be that I was gaining more control?",
        "Dr. Bright: I- I was thinking about your mother. I know she\u2019ll be so relieved to hear that you\u2019re improving. ",
        "Chloe: Oh, okay. Um, all of this has made my head hurt a bit. I think we should call it day. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you sure, Chloe? I promise you, this is a safe place. We still haven\u2019t done our meditation exercises for today. I don\u2019t want you to hinder your own progress. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s just- it\u2019s been an overwhelming day. I\u2019m sorry for yelling at you. I think I just need to go home and think about some stuff. ",

        "Damien: So you keep saying. But...doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to know what they\u2019re up to. I mean, come on, a shadowy government agency that the public doesn\u2019t know about? It\u2019s my own personal thriller mystery! ",

        "Damien: Yes, you did tell me that. But then you told me you were lying, so you\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t buy that particular company line. What I want to know is, what the hell are you doing in bed with them? Occasional confidentiality slips aside, you\u2019re a good doctor and - even more annoyingly - a good person. Even I\u2019ve picked up on that after 10 months. So why work with something that scares you so much?",

His ability is incredibly hard to work with - when he uses it it feels as though your brain is being invaded. Though it didn\u2019t always feel that way; I\u2019ve gotten better at noticing when his consciousness is invading mine and I think he\u2019s gotten more careless with me. But when we first started...well, my notes are essentially useless from the first few months of our sessions. I couldn\u2019t feel his consciousness at first - I was telling him, wanting to tell him things that I never would have told a patient. I didn\u2019t know what was happening. He was surprised as I was when I figured out what he could do. I guess he had gone through many therapists before coming to me - I was just next on the list of professionals in the area. Once he realized I knew about his ability - knew about other\u2019s abilities - he stuck around. And I still have no idea what to do with him. ",

        "Caleb: Yeah, he did. Well, no, actually. It scared me, not him. I-I knew he wasn\u2019t going to do anything with it. With any of the emotions, I mean. He seemed stuck. Like, totally trapped inside of his feelings and it was just- it was really awful. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very sorry to hear that. Were you able to push his feelings away at all? You\u2019ve made a lot of progress with blocking out certain emotions. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. But, no. I couldn\u2019t. It all came on, like, way too strong, way too fast. And then the bus came and I got on and it all started to fade away the further I got from him. But it left a bad taste in my mouth. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand that. But it is unlikely that you will encounter this kind of emotional turmoil often. You should\u2019t be worried or afraid. ",
        "Caleb: No, I know. I just, I feel bad for him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. ",
        "Caleb: I think...I think maybe it would be nice to help people like him someday. Like, Use my ability for something good. Something productive. What. Why are you smiling at me like that?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just - you remind of the other person I mentioned. You two had very similar reactions to meeting what sounds like the same man. It gives me a lot of hope for the world that people like you are out there, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Oh. Uh, thanks. But can you like, stop feeling that way? It feels weird - like my mom feels when I do well in school or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, I\u2019m sorry Caleb, but I\u2019m proud of you. You know people can\u2019t control how they feel, even me. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, okay. So this other person - are they a patient?",
        "Dr. Bright: Uh, yes. Yes they are.",
        "Caleb: And do they feel other people\u2019s emotions too?",
        "Dr. Bright: Not exactly.",
        "Caleb: But they can do something different, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not allowed to discuss other patients, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Okay. I just - I hadn\u2019t really ever thought about there being other people out there like me. Are all your patients like that? Like, special?",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t tell you that, I\u2019m afraid. ",
        "Caleb: Wow. Other freaks. Weird thought. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, you\u2019re not a freak. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I am. I mean, that\u2019s why I barely leave my house except for school and football. And why I never go to parties, even though I\u2019m always invited, and why I have no friends - because they all can tell. They can all tell that I\u2019m a freak. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You feel like you don\u2019t have any friends? What about Adam?",
        "Caleb: Adam will figure it out eventually. He\u2019s smart. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you\u2019ve said. And he\u2019s chosen you as a friend - shouldn\u2019t that tell you something?",
        "Caleb: Smart people can make bad personal decisions. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s very true. Do you feel like you\u2019re a bad decision for Adam?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know! I mean, we get along, yeah. Like, we like hanging out, and he\u2019s been helping me study - we\u2019re bros or whatever. But then there\u2019s the other thing and I feel like I\u2019m lying to him you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because you haven\u2019t told him you want to be more than friends?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. No. It\u2019s- it\u2019s that he wants that too. I think. And it feels like lying because I feel things for him and then I also feel that he feels things for me. And isn\u2019t that cheating? That I already know? And he doesn\u2019t? I mean, I don\u2019t think he knows. Do you think he knows?",
        "Dr. Bright: About how you feel? I don\u2019t know, Caleb. What have you told him?",
        "Caleb: Nothing. And that\u2019s the problem. I want to tell him- I want to tell him everything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What\u2019s holding you back? If you know that there\u2019s a good chance that your feelings are reciprocated, than it seems worth the risk to tell him how you feel. ",
        "Caleb: No, I mean, I want to tell him everything. About me. About my ability, about my issues with anger. All of it. I mean, he deserves to know, he\u2019s my best friend. I mean is that crazy? That we\u2019ve been hanging out for two months and he\u2019s already the best friend I\u2019ve ever had?",
        "Dr. Bright: We can become very close with other people very quickly depending on the circumstances. Sometimes those fast-made relationships fade as quickly as they formed, but sometimes they create bonds that last forever. Which do you think you and Adam have?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. I think- I think he might know me better than anyone else ever has. Even without knowing about my problem. Like, he gets that I get really angry sometimes. And I think he knows that I get angry when he does. Because I\u2019ll feel him start to get angry and then I\u2019ll watch him try to control his face so I can\u2019t tell. Like, he thinks whenever he looks mad, I get mad too. I mean, he does get this kind of look about him - like, his eyes narrow and his eyebrows kind of scrunch up and his lips go, like, really thin, so, you know, even if you\u2019re not me, it\u2019s really easy to tell when he\u2019s pissed. But when I\u2019m around and someone says something that gets him riled up or he\u2019s talking about politics or, like, whatever, he\u2019ll try to smooth his face over so I don\u2019t see that he\u2019s angry. Which is, like, so dumb because obviously, him pretending doesn\u2019t work, I can still feel it, but. He tries. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds like you\u2019re thankful for that.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I am. I mean, I don\u2019t want to get into any more fights and Adam\u2019s anger is, like, so strong sometimes and it feels so much like mine that it\u2019s hard to push away. But when I watch him try to hide it, it kind of, like, breaks the spell - it makes me smile.",
        "Dr. Bright: That sounds like a good friendship to me, Caleb. You\u2019re both considerate of the other\u2019s feelings. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, exactly. Like, when I went away for the game, he made me this mix to listen to on the bus. Because he knows that sometimes spending a lot of time around my teammates can bend me out of shape a bit. Like, he\u2019ll usually meet me after practices and just start cracking jokes - like he knows I\u2019m coming down from something. And it really helps. Because, as much as I love football, there\u2019s always, like, you know, a bit of whiplash after playing where I have to adjust to not being in that sort of, group feeling, you know? And so, anyway, so he made me this mix, with all these little notes in it, and told me to listen to it because he couldn\u2019t be there to snap me out of \u201cdumb football mode\u201d. That\u2019s what he calls it. He doesn\u2019t know anything about football. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Adam seems like a great friend to you. How well are you balancing things with him currently? You said his anger is sometimes hard to separate from yours, but is that true for all his feelings?",
        "Caleb: Um, I don\u2019t know, really. I always know what\u2019s mine but sometimes we get, like, so in sync that it doesn\u2019t matter what I feel and what he feels. I think maybe we\u2019ve grown so close that it doesn\u2019t really matter whose emotions are whose, you know? ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you feel about that?",
        "Caleb: Well, I like it most of the time. It\u2019s nice not to have to fight against someone\u2019s feelings. Like I\u2019ve said, his just fit into my body really well so it\u2019s less like having emotions pushed on me and more like, I don\u2019t know, welcoming them in. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That sounds nice. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, except...",
        "Dr. Bright: Except?",
        "Caleb: Well, I can tell what\u2019s mine but I can\u2019t always tell what\u2019s his, you know? Like, the feeling that I have for him - the feeling feelings...sometimes it feels like it\u2019s doubled, like the butterflies just start multiplying and going crazy and it\u2019s really, really nice and really weird but...how do I know if any of that is coming from him? Like at all? What if it\u2019s just my own feelings getting out of control? I mean, even when I\u2019m alone, even when he\u2019s not around, there are some big feelings that just don\u2019t fit right. Like they\u2019re too big. And that\u2019s happened before, but it\u2019s so much worse with this. And isn\u2019t that just, like, teenage hormones or whatever? Like, my dumb brain making a big deal out of nothing? Or is there something seriously wrong with me?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with you, Caleb. It sounds like you\u2019re in-",
        "Caleb: No, I know what you\u2019re going to say. And that\u2019s - I mean, even if that we\u2019re true, which I\u2019m not saying it is, like, how can I trust that? I know you say that everything I feel and everything everybody else feels is valid, but when I\u2019m feeling all of it, doesn\u2019t it kind of cancel itself out? I mean, what if prolonged exposure to other people\u2019s emotions has made me totally delusional. What if nothing I feel is actually real?",
        "Dr. Bright: But you said you still feel these things when you\u2019re by yourself. Shouldn\u2019t that tell you that those emotions are your own?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess. But, I just...",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re scared. ",
        "Caleb: What? No, I\u2019m not. Okay, yeah, I\u2019m scared. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What are you scared of?",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m scared that this feeling will go away. And I\u2019m scared that it won\u2019t. I\u2019m scared that if I told him, it would ruin everything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I hate to tell you, Caleb, but feeling that way isn\u2019t unique to you and your ability. And it won\u2019t necessarily get easier with age. There\u2019s always the fear of losing someone. Or of losing a feeling.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. But most people aren't in this particular situation. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s true. But you know yourself, Caleb. Better than a lot of other people your age and better than some adults I know. You have to trust yourself. Think about other crushes you\u2019ve had, or even other times that you\u2019ve felt strong emotions both in yourself and from other people. How does this compare?",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s- it\u2019s bigger than any of that. And it is fucking terrifying. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what do you think would be the best way to handle it?",
        "Caleb: To tell him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s good, Caleb. That\u2019s very brave.",
        "Caleb: But I was serious before, I want to tell him everything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you feel that\u2019s important?",
        "Caleb: Because honesty is important, right? In a relationship? I mean- not that, like, I don\u2019t even know what label he\u2019d want to- never mind. Look, I just mean, I\u2019ve already been lying to him so much. I\u2019ve had a head start in every conversation we\u2019ve ever had and that\u2019s not fair. If I\u2019m going to tell him how I feel, I think it\u2019s important that he has- that he has all the pertinent information before he makes a decision about me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think that\u2019s very wise, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: You do? But, how do I have that conversation? How do you tell someone you have superpowers?",
        "Dr. Bright: You had that conversation with your sister didn\u2019t you? I know your parents were there, but you did most of the explaining, isn\u2019t that right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but she\u2019s my sister. She has to love me, no matter what. He- well, what if he doesn\u2019t believe me?",
        "Dr. Bright: It might be a good idea to include your parents in this conversation, if you\u2019re really serious about having it with him. ",
        "Caleb: Ugh, no, I don\u2019t want my parents explaining it to him. That\u2019s so embarrassing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Your condition is not completely unheard of in the more established medical community. I can give you some literature on empathy and mirror touch synesthesia, which is a somewhat related, documented disorder. You can use those to present the concept to him and then take it from there. ",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re really on board with this?",
        "Dr. Bright: You didn\u2019t think I would be?",
        "Caleb: No, I mean, the only other time we talked about it was in my first few sessions and you said I should never tell anyone about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I do believe that it\u2019s best to keep the subject between family and close friends but, Caleb, you\u2019ve made remarkable progress. When I said that, I wasn\u2019t sure how much your ability would affect your life. I deal with much more serious cases in this office - people who have very extreme abilities. You are not one of those people. I think you should be able to live a largely normal life. And having your parents and sister know about your ability has been immensely helpful to you. I think bringing Adam in on it might help you even further. ",
        "Caleb: Oh. Okay. Wow, thanks, Dr. Bright.",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s my pleasure, Caleb. Now, let me dig up some of that information and we can go over it together so you\u2019ll be able to explain it to Adam...",
        "[sfx: ticking clock]",
        "(time passes)",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright, Caleb, take a little bit to think about it and talk it over with your parents - don\u2019t rush into anything, but I think telling Adam is something you can achieve in the next few weeks. Does that sound good?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, that sounds great. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And if you want to bring Adam in, have me explain some of it to him, you just let me know. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, okay, thanks but that would also be, like, super embarrassing. Taking a guy to your therapist is not great first date stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Fair enough. Just call me if you need anything okay?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I will. ",
        "[sfx: opening door]",
        "Dr. Bright: Good. Oh, and Caleb? At which bus stop was it that you saw that homeless man?",

        "Dr. Bright: End of session 15. My hope is that by the time the patient graduates high school, he will no longer need to attend sessions with me. While I do have some trepidation about telling more people, based off the conversations I\u2019ve had with Caleb\u2019s mother, Adam seems like a responsible and trustworthy young man. I think including him in this part of Caleb\u2019s life could be a huge step forward. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Personal log, day 568. Unfortunately, I am not any closer to determining how to get Mark back. I still have six weeks until my quarterly evaluation with Agent Green, but I confess I am not as hopeful as I was a month ago. I have not been able to reach Chloe or Sam and, without either of them, I\u2019m back at square one. I keep watching the same footage over and over, reading the file again and again, hoping to see something new, notice something I didn\u2019t before. But I can\u2019t find a way through it. Mark is stuck. And I\u2019m stuck. So once again, I turn to Plan B - maybe if I can get his body, I\u2019ll be able to figure out the rest from there. But then there\u2019s the question of what kind of treatment he\u2019s been undergoing with The-",

        "Sam: You have?",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. We didn\u2019t leave things very well last time and I\u2019ve been trying to get a hold of you. I want to apologize.",
        "Sam: You tried to get a hold of me? When?",
        "Dr. Bright: For the past few weeks - you didn\u2019t get my messages?",
        "Sam: Uh, no I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve- I\u2019ve been away quite a bit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. Have the lengths of the trips changed? In how much time passes here, I mean. ",
        "Sam: No, no, not really. It\u2019s, um- I\u2019ve been going on a lot of trips. And I\u2019ve just sort of lost track of things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How frequent have these trips been?",
        "Sam: Um, I don\u2019t know, a couple times a day. ",
        "Dr. Bright: More than once a day?",
        "Sam: Yes. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. Something happened. And I don\u2019t know if it was a fluke or-or if- I don\u2019t understand it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, deep breaths, Sam. Start from the beginning. ",
        "Sam: Okay, well. The past month - well, after I left your office, I just started remembering everything and I barely made it home before I went away again. And then it was just like that for weeks - I kept flickering in and out, I barely felt like I was here, I felt like I wasn\u2019t even solid. And even when I was here, well- I just hadn\u2019t dwelled on that stuff in a really long time and I thought I had it handled, but I guess I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve just been one bad day away from disaster this entire time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You are not a disaster. You\u2019ve experienced multiple traumas and you\u2019ve never spoken to anyone about them - it takes great endurance to survive that. You are incredibly strong, Sam. Don\u2019t forget that.",
        "Sam: It hasn\u2019t felt like that these past few weeks. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m so sorry to hear that the trips have gotten worse. You know you can always come to me. ",
        "Sam: I know. But I just wasn\u2019t sure if I could trust you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. And I\u2019m very sorry for that. You weren\u2019t entirely wrong at your last session - I was interested in observing one of your trips again. But it wasn\u2019t on a whim, or to make you feel like a circus act, and I am so sorry for making you feel manipulated. But I wanted to observe so that I could better understand your condition. There\u2019s no literature on this, Sam - no scientific journal I can look up to help me figure it out. But that\u2019s no excuse. I should have respected your boundaries and not pushed you to try and control something that you weren\u2019t ready to. ",
        "Sam: Thank you. I appreciate that. But I think you were right - I think I can learn to control it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What makes you say that?",
        "Sam: Well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Like I said, the trips were getting worse and happening more frequently and I thought- I thought I was never going to get out of it and then I went somewhere I never thought I would go. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Where?",
        "Sam: I went back to the accident. My- my parents\u2019 accident, the one that killed them.",
        "Dr. Bright: What happened? When you arrived, where were you? What did you see?",
        "Sam: I landed in the front yard of our house, and I opened my eyes and I saw my parents and me getting into the car. And I knew, I knew immediately that this was the day. And it put me in total shock - I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing and I just sort of went on autopilot. I climbed into the back seat, sitting next to my dad and - oh my god, he looked so young. And my mom - I\u2019d forgotten what she looked like when she smiled and for a minute, just a minute, I didn\u2019t think about what was about to happen. I was just back in the car with my parents. I was sitting right behind the other me, so I couldn\u2019t really see her face. My face. Ooh, that\u2019s weird, I haven\u2019t really had time to process that part of it yet. But my parents, they looked so happy, and they were so encouraging of me, so patient and kind. And then I started to notice the streets around me and I realized we were just half a mile from the intersection where it happened and I started to panic - me me, not the other me. And I was thinking, \u201cI do not want to see this happen again. I cannot watch this happen again\u201d. Or, well, I guess I would have been seeing it for the first time. Because I wasn\u2019t even there when it happened. I mean, that\u2019s why it happened. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s okay, Sam. Remember it isn\u2019t your fault. Did you- did you see the accident?",
        "Sam: No, I didn\u2019t. I was thinking how I couldn\u2019t bear it and everything stopped. I froze time. It was like in that movie Clockstoppers - have you ever seen that movie? No, of course not, it does not seem like your kind of movie. But it\u2019s one of the last movies I saw in theaters, so I remember it pretty well. Which is sort of sad. But once the trips really started to get going, I couldn\u2019t really go to the movies anymore. The people, the dark space, the loud noises -  it was too much. Anyway, it was just like that movie - everything was frozen in place and I just moved around it. Well, I guess, technically in the movie, he was moving really fast, not actually stopping time so- ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam. ",
        "Sam: Right, sorry. I\u2019m just. It still seems a bit surreal. I mean, I\u2019ve never been able to do anything - anything - when on my trips. And then I just stopped everything, just like that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That is fairly remarkable. ",
        "Sam: That isn\u2019t even the best part. I came back. After everything went still, I got out of the car, looked around and just thought to myself, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here right now. I would give anything to be anywhere but here\u201d. And then I came back. I thought about coming back to the present, and I felt the air pull on me, and I shut my eyes really tight and then-  then I was just standing in my kitchen. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, this- this is an excellent step- ",
        "Sam: Wait, I\u2019m not done. When I came back, I was standing in front of the microwave - I had been heating up my lunch, I don\u2019t cook just in case I go away and burn my whole apartment down - and only seconds had passed since I left. Seconds! It\u2019s never been that fast before. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you saying that you brought yourself back to almost the exact moment that you left?",
        "Sam: Yeah. I think I did. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, this is wonderful news. Have you been able to replicate this at all in other trips?",
        "Sam: No, I literally just got back from that one. I took the pasta out of the microwave and came straight here. I had to talk to someone and well. You\u2019re the only person in the entire world who knows about me, so... ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I know I\u2019m not your first choice of confidant after our last session but I am very glad that you came to see me. ",
        "Sam: No, it\u2019s okay. I think I can forgive you for that. I mean, it was a really, really cruel thing to do, but, well, I need you if I\u2019m going to figure this out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Figure what out?",
        "Sam: Figure out how to control it. Think about it, if I\u2019m able to come and go as I please, then maybe I could go back and fix things. Stop my parents from getting into the car that day. Save them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, this is very good progress but I don\u2019t want you to get ahead of yourself. ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m not! But I stopped time and then traveled forwards through it by just thinking about it - I wasn\u2019t even trying. Not really. Imagine what I could do if I was trying, if I had full control. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I didn\u2019t mean that you could go back in time and change the course of history. I think you will be able to control it - control when you leave and when you come back. But I don\u2019t think that would change what you can do when you\u2019re in other times. ",
        "Sam: Why not?",
        "Dr. Bright: It just simply isn\u2019t possible. ",
        "Sam: How on earth can you say that? None of this should be possible. I can time travel. I told you that 5 minutes after meeting you and you believed me instantly. Why are you drawing a line now?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because there are limits to every ability. I told you I\u2019ve had other patients with other extraordinary capabilities. Yes, some of them - including yourself - can do things that beggar belief. But these powers, these gifts, are not limitless. ",
        "Sam: But you just said that you don\u2019t know anything about my ability. For all you know, my limits could be much greater than anyone else\u2019s. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They could be. But time travel is fixed. It\u2019s a spectator sport - no one with such an ability has ever been able to affect the past. ",
        "Sam: No one- what do you mean, no one with such an ability? You said you\u2019d never seen anyone like me before.",
        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t personally worked with someone of your talents before, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. ",
        "Sam: Who are you?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Sam: If you haven\u2019t worked with other time travelers before, then how do you know they exist? Is there some secret society of scifi heroes I don\u2019t know about? Are there other therapists like you?",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course, Sam. I\u2019m one person in one city. This kind of atypical biology is not unique to our location. There are others who struggle with similar issues and they have people who work with them and study their abilities, just like me. ",
        "Sam: What do you mean, of course? Why would that be something I assume?",
        "Dr. Bright: You came to me because I advertised therapy for the strange and unusual, did you not? You knew I had other patients who had special abilities. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, but, I- I just thought-",
        "Dr. Bright: You thought I\u2019d found the only atypicals in the world?",
        "Sam: I- I guess not. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it that much, to be honest. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s understandable. Your own ability gives you plenty to think about without worrying about the larger picture. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, I guess. But I\u2019m sorry - I\u2019m still a little confused. Do you or do you not have previous knowledge about time travel? Because you are saying a lot of contradictory things here. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I have read about other time travelers, it\u2019s true. But I meant it when I said your ability was more unique than any I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone physically leaving this time and traveling to another. ",
        "Sam: What- what do you mean? What other kind of time travel is there?",
        "Dr. Bright: The mental kind. ",
        "Sam: Mental time travel? What is that?",
        "Dr. Bright: There have been documented atypicals who have been able to push their consciousness back in time. Their body stays here, in the present, but they fall unconscious - they look like they\u2019re in a deep sleep to a casual observer - but really their mind is in another time. Another place. ",
        "Sam: What, like they're dreaming?",
        "Dr. Bright: Sort of. Except, to them, as far as I know, it seems just like normal life. It doesn\u2019t have any of the confusing logic or limitless possibilities that dreams have. They are in reality. Just in a reality that is long past. ",
        "Sam: Like the Pensieve. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The what?",
        "Sam: It\u2019s this thing, in Harry Potter- ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah yes, right, I remember that. Yes, actually, that is a good comparison. From the descriptions I\u2019ve read, it does sound a bit like going into someone\u2019s memory. But, as far as we know, it isn\u2019t subject to any one specific perspective. These time travelers see history as it happened - not the narrative of someone\u2019s thoughts. It\u2019s like that for you, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: Well, yes, I guess. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever thought about the historical and narrative accuracy of my trips. I\u2019ve always taken it for granted.",
        "Dr. Bright: But for instance, today - the trip to the day of the accident. Was that as it happened, or as you remembered it?",
        "Sam: No, it was definitely how it happened. Because I noticed things that I didn\u2019t before - like the color of my dad\u2019s sweater or people walking on the sidewalk. So, wait, how many time travelers are there in the world?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s hard to say. The one mental time traveler I am familiar with - the one I\u2019ve read about - had a good amount of control over the ability. But given the nature of the ability, someone in your position - someone who doesn\u2019t have control over it - may just think that they are falling asleep and having very vivid dreams. ",
        "Sam: So what - all the narcoleptics in the world are actually time traveling?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know. ",
        "Sam: Oh my god- I was kidding. But that\u2019s really a possibility?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t be. ",
        "Sam: Okay, so that seems likely but the idea of me changing the past when I can already move through time is somehow too unbelievable?",
        "Dr. Bright: Like I said, Sam - it\u2019s never been done. ",
        "Sam: But if I\u2019m the only one who physically goes back than it doesn\u2019t really matter what the precedent is, does it?",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019ve said it yourself - you\u2019re not really corporeal. You can\u2019t affect the space around you at all. ",
        "Sam: But before today, I couldn\u2019t control anything at all. So you don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible! You don\u2019t know what I could be capable of! ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I just don\u2019t want you to get your hopes up. This is a good step forward but that\u2019s all it is - one step. And I think if we work together, we can keep moving forward. But let\u2019s just take it one step at a time, okay?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thinking maybe coming here was a bad idea. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I promise I won\u2019t make you do anything you don\u2019t want to do. ",
        "Sam: It\u2019s not that, it's- it'sll the other stuff. How do you know about the other time travelers? How are you so calm about all of this? Are you special too? I don\u2019t know anything about you and I\u2019ve entrusted you with the biggest secret I have.",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right. ",
        "Sam: I am?",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I want you to trust me. I need you to trust me so that I can help you. This isn\u2019t usually a two-way street, but, then again, I\u2019m not a usual therapist. There are certain things that will be important for you to know if we\u2019re going to be productive.",
        "Sam: You mean, about the other time travelers?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Before I started practicing here, as a private psychologist, I worked for a non-profit. They recruited me in graduate school and I assisted them in their research on atypicals.",
        "Sam: What kind of research?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t discuss the specifics with you - the confidentiality agreements were very strict. But after a few years there, I discovered that the organization was not dedicated to the kind of work that I had set out to do. They had different priorities, so I left, came here and started working on a smaller scale. ",
        "Sam: Why are you telling me this?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because this is the kind of work that I wanted to do - help individual atypicals understand and control their abilities. And that will only work if we can be open with each other. ",
        "Sam: So is that what I am? An atypical?",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s how you are identified to people like me. Are you prepared to identify yourself that way? Someone who is aware of and working with a special ability?",
        "Sam: Yes. I\u2019m ready. I want to take control. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Good. Let\u2019s get to work. ",
        "[fade out; time passing]",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, Sam. Keep up with those exercises and if you\u2019re ready, next session you can try going on a trip. On purpose for once. And I will be here when you get back, no matter what. ",
        "Sam: Okay, that sounds - well, let\u2019s just see how it goes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. ",
        "Sam: Just so we\u2019re clear - I still have a lot of questions. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. But let\u2019s just focus on you and we\u2019ll handle your questions as they come up. But you\u2019re safe here. ",

        "Dr. Bright: End of session six. The patient has made incredible steps forward but I\u2019m concerned about her fixation on fixing the past. Despite her objections, I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. That being said, I think this is an excellent sign that she will be able to help Mark. I would have preferred a few more weeks of sessions before telling her about my time with The AM, but I think it was important to open up a little to get her to come back. Once we\u2019ve established a rapport again, I\u2019ll tell her about Mark - this won\u2019t work without her full cooperation. But until then, I have to gain her trust back. She\u2019s much more confident than the last time I saw her. I was seeing glimpses of this in our first five sessions, but I think today was the first time I saw the complete Samantha Barnes. The woman who has survived loss, and wars, and repeated physical traumas in the form of time manipulation. She\u2019s not as malleable and desperate as she was when she first came to me, but I think this new determination - this new comfort with her ability and trust in herself - will ultimately work in our favor.",

She said she has been doing better with the voices - she has been applying the meditation and mindfulness exercises that I taught her to positive affect. While this does give me some concern that she will be able to hear my own thoughts more easily, I think being more honest with her will ultimately help us both. Besides, if I eventually were to ask for her help with Agent Green, I would need to tell her everything. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very happy you\u2019ve come back to see me. I know you\u2019ve been doing well over these past few weeks but I still think we can do a lot of good work together. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I suppose it was. ",
        "Chloe: You weren\u2019t - you weren\u2019t following me, right? ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, of course not. ",
        "Chloe: You\u2019re lying. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe-",
        "Chloe: No, don\u2019t. If we\u2019re going to do this, you need to start telling me the truth. I could hear what you were thinking. You were thinking about Frank. Why? What does he have to do with any of this?",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, Chloe, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right - I do need to be more honest with you. But I promise you, I really am just trying to protect my other patients. ",
        "Chloe: What do you mean? Frank isn\u2019t a patient of yours.",
        "Dr. Bright: No, no, it\u2019s - Chloe, I wasn\u2019t lying when I said I wasn\u2019t following you. I would never violate your boundaries like that. But one of my other patients - he crossed paths with Frank as well. And he had a similar reaction to when you first encountered Frank. So I asked my patient where he had seen this man. It seemed like too strange of a coincidence that the abilities of two of my patients had responded in such a way to the same individual. I thought maybe Frank was special too and I thought I should try to find him to see if I could help. ",
        "Chloe: Oh. And that\u2019s all? You just wanted to help Frank?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I was rather hoping that I might run into you as well. I thought that maybe you would still be walking around that neighborhood.",
        "Chloe: And you just got lucky that I was there on your first try. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Did you just hear me think that?",
        "Chloe: Yes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s good, Chloe. That\u2019s very good. Are you able to hear most thoughts like that these days - as complete sentences?",
        "Chloe: Sometimes. It really depends on the person. Your thoughts are pretty organized - you think in straight lines, so it\u2019s a little easier to hear what you\u2019re thinking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What am I thinking right now?",
        "Chloe: Well...hm, a lot of different things. But they\u2019re running parallel to each other, if that makes sense. It\u2019s not a jumble like it is with some other people. You\u2019re thinking how interesting it is that I\u2019m hearing thoughts in this way and- oh, yes. Yeah, he\u2019s one of those people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Chloe: Oh, sorry, you- you were wondering if Frank was one of those people that has jumbled thoughts. And yes, yes he is. Oh, but you don\u2019t think he\u2019s special? You think he\u2019s just sick. And you don\u2019t think I can help him, you don\u2019t think that I\u2019m strong enough to help him-",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, please, slow down. This is- well, you are much farther along in controlling your ability than I was expecting. You\u2019re going to have to give me a little bit of time to let me catch up. ",
        "Chloe: Right, sorry. It\u2019s just - you think a lot. And so quickly, and so much of it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. I\u2019m just trying to pick out what I\u2019m able to.",
        "Dr. Bright: What doesn\u2019t make sense to you? Is it the way you\u2019re hearing the thoughts or the speed at which they are happening?",
        "Chloe: No it\u2019s - it\u2019s when you\u2019re thinking about science. I don\u2019t know anything about neuroscience or psychology, so all of that stuff sort of goes over my head. Just because it makes sense in your mind doesn\u2019t mean it makes sense in mine. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Does that happen a lot? Someone is thinking about a specific area of knowledge that you don\u2019t have and you find it difficult to process their thoughts?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, it happens sometimes. Or when people think in shortcuts. ",
        "Dr. Bright: In shortcuts?",
        "Chloe: Yeah. Some people have shortcuts in their brain for thinking about stuff that\u2019s specific to them. Like, they\u2019ll be thinking of something and all of a sudden, they\u2019re thinking about something completely different. And the jump makes sense to them - it\u2019s a logical connection in their brain - but I don\u2019t get it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Like an inside joke. Verbal cues that trigger a memory or specific connection?",
        "Chloe: Right! And by the time I catch up to the change in subject, their mind has already moved on. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But, despite all of this, it seems that you are hearing things much more clearly. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I am, most of the time. But it\u2019s still hard in public or large groups. ",
        "Dr. Bright: In our last session, you mentioned that you were thinking of returning to school. Did you?",
        "Chloe: Um, sort of. Me and my mom had a meeting with my advisor and tried to explain things as best we could. We used- we used the schizophrenia as an excuse. I know that\u2019s sort of not cool because there are people who really have that and it\u2019s difficult but- it was just easier than trying to explain the real reason. And, well, the advisor agreed that lectures were probably not a good idea. But she\u2019s enrolled me in some independent study - studio time and private tutoring, that kind of stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful to hear. Getting back to routine is an important part of learning to live with your ability.  ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, the university has been pretty helpful, which is really nice. I know it wouldn\u2019t be this easy if I was a medical student or something, but the art department can be pretty freeform depending on the courses you\u2019re taking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how is the independent study going?",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s going well, actually! I\u2019m doing two different ones - one with my ceramics professor and another one in- well, in social work, actually. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Really?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I- well, as you saw the other day, I\u2019ve been talking to Frank more. And I\u2019ve gotten him to go to the Vet center a couple of times, and I\u2019m trying to get him to go to the VA - you know, get a check up, maybe admit himself until he\u2019s better? And well, I\u2019ve been volunteering there a bit. And my hours there are counting towards my credits, so it works out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, while I think it\u2019s wonderful that you are volunteering, I don\u2019t want this fixation on Frank to take over your life. If it weren\u2019t for him, is social work something you would be interested in?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019ve never really thought about it. But I do enjoy the volunteering, really. It\u2019s just- it seemed like the best way to get to know him a little bit better. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And why is getting to know him so important to you? Because he\u2019s sick?",
        "Chloe: No. Well, maybe a little, but I\u2019m not- I\u2019m not making him my project or anything if that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting. I just - he doesn\u2019t have anyone, okay? And he needs to paint, he needs to get these paintings out of his head and onto canvas and if he doesn\u2019t- well I know what that\u2019s like! To have art inside of you that you need to get out! So much has happened to him and it\u2019s the only way he knows how to process it: I see the war and his dad\u2019s death, something with lilies - I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all a little abstract. And I\u2019m the only one who can- he doesn\u2019t have anyone and there\u2019s no one who understands but I understand, I can help him! ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, Chloe, it\u2019s okay. ",
        "Chloe: I can just hear you thinking that I\u2019m going about this the wrong way. That I\u2019m just some silly college student who\u2019s trying to take on more responsibility than she can handle. But I\u2019m not- I\u2019m not romanticizing this. I know who he is - better than anyone. And you\u2019re right - you don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be an artist. You don\u2019t have an artist\u2019s brain. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe. It\u2019s not like you to insult me.",
        "Chloe: I wasn\u2019t- okay, I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t like hearing my thoughts very much, do you?",
        "Chloe: No, I guess I don\u2019t. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think that is?",
        "Chloe: They\u2019re cold. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You find me cold?",
        "Chloe: Well, a little, sometimes, but it\u2019s not really you- it\u2019s the way you think. I know that sounds bizarre, but there is a difference. Your thinking is so orderly. Clinical. Which I guess makes sense, because you\u2019re a doctor, but it\u2019s- it\u2019s uncomfortable. It kind of chafes? Or no, it\u2019s more like it pokes. Like, cold spikes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, I feel like I should apologize. That sounds very unpleasant.",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s not all bad. I mean, I can tell that there\u2019s a lot going on underneath the surface. That you\u2019re caring. I can\u2019t hear them, but some of your thoughts - your more distant thoughts - they\u2019re warm. Comforting. But you try to push them away - that\u2019s what I don\u2019t like. You have these thoughts about, well, I\u2019m not sure really. I think they\u2019re about people? Maybe your patients? Or no, one patient. Yeah, it\u2019s- you think about him a lot. Not the one who\u2019s dangerous, those thoughts are cold and pointy too - no this is someone who I remind you of? Or, we\u2019re similar? He has a similar ability to me. Can he read minds too? No, just feelings. Oh, he\u2019s the one who told you about Frank - that makes sense. He felt Frank\u2019s emotions. God, I know what that\u2019s like - that\u2019s not always a fun ride.",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe- ",
        "Chloe: So this patient, he\u2019s like me. And you care about him. He reminds you of someone but it\u2019s not me. No it\u2019s, someone else. Someone else that\u2019s in your warm thoughts. Who\u2019s Mark?",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, please. I would like to maintain some semblance of doctor patient confidentiality. ",
        "Chloe: You really mean that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course I do. ",
        "Chloe: Well, you\u2019re the one thinking about him. You don\u2019t have to. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, yes, but that\u2019s a bit like telling someone not to think of pink elephants. Inevitably, they think of pink elephants. ",
        "Chloe: You\u2019re right. I can see them - in your head and mine. But I\u2019m not going to apologize for what I can do. I can\u2019t help what I hear but I\u2019m not going to use it for anything bad. I know this is a powerful ability, but I would never use someone\u2019s thoughts against them. Yeah, me too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You too, what?",
        "Chloe: What were you just thinking?",
        "Dr. Bright: I was thinking that I\u2019m happy you have this ability and not someone else. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah. Me too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe-",
        "Chloe: He\u2019s in trouble, isn\u2019t he?",
        "Dr. Bright: My patient? No, he\u2019s fine. Safe and sound. ",
        "Chloe: No. The other one. The one your patient reminds you of. Mark. He\u2019s in trouble. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. He is. ",
        "Chloe: And you can\u2019t do anything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m trying to. ",
        "Chloe: But you\u2019re responsible. It\u2019s your fault he\u2019s in trouble. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Chloe: Because you\u2019re thinking it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Not everything we think is true, Chloe. Especially about ourselves. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What are you apologizing for?",
        "Chloe: For making you think about him. I get why you push the thoughts away. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They\u2019re not all warm, are they?",
        "Chloe: No, they\u2019re not. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What else do you hear, Chloe?",
        "Chloe: From you?",
        "Dr. Bright: We might as well. ",
        "Chloe: The thoughts are still there. Underneath the surface. Are they- they\u2019re different. They\u2019ve got a different hue to them - they\u2019re memories?",
        "Dr. Bright: Very good. ",
        "Chloe: You don\u2019t have any warm thoughts about him that are new? Oh, you haven\u2019t seen him in a while. He\u2019s trapped and you failed. You didn\u2019t protect him like you were supposed to. You didn\u2019t take care of him like mom and dad said to- oh! Mark\u2019s your brother?",
        "Dr. Bright: Actually, I think that\u2019s enough for today. ",
        "Chloe: What? ",
        "Dr. Bright: If I\u2019m going to be the one you practice on, then I\u2019ll need to prepare a little bit better. Think about my own thought process and how to help you navigate through it. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m sorry I made you think about him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Don\u2019t apologize, Chloe. I\u2019m always thinking about him. ",
        "Chloe: So, was it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Was what?",
        "Chloe: Was it your fault? That he got trapped?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know, Chloe. What\u2019s done is done and I\u2019m not sure I could have done anything to change that. ",
        "Chloe: That\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking right now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. ",
        "Chloe: I guess - I guess a lot of what Frank is thinking might not be true. Right? I mean, he\u2019s sick, so how do I know if any of what he\u2019s thinking is actually a fact?",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t. But it\u2019s true to him. And that\u2019s all that matters in the end. But start with what you know. Start with the art.  ",
        "Chloe: That\u2019s good advice. I know you\u2019re thinking that you don\u2019t know what to tell me, but that sounds like good advice to me. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve made you doubt yourself. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You haven\u2019t. I am just realizing that I am vastly out of my depth with you, Chloe. So much of therapy is saying the right thing to a patient, which is impossible when the patient knows what you\u2019re really thinking. ",
        "Chloe: But it\u2019s a good challenge?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, it\u2019s a good challenge. ",
        "Chloe: And I can help you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Chloe: That\u2019s what you think - you think I can help you. But that\u2019s all I heard. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to help you with. I thought that was your job. ",
        "Dr. Bright: To be perfectly frank - and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a point in being otherwise - I don\u2019t know what my job is with you, Chloe. Give me a few weeks to play catch up, develop a new plan for you. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any point in treating these sessions as true therapy - we may as well use them to help you hone your ability. But any time you need to talk, you call me. Day or night, and I\u2019ll be here. ",
        "Chloe: Because I can\u2019t read your thoughts through the phone, right?",

        "Dr. Bright: Yes, you said you were able to go on a trip on your own?",
        "Sam: Right, yes. But that\u2019s not even the most extraordinary part. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, well, let\u2019s start from the beginning. ",
        "Sam: Okay, um. So, I haven\u2019t been able to go on a trip on purpose since that session of ours last week. And I\u2019ve been practicing at home, every day, like you\u2019ve taught me, but it\u2019s just hard to do without you guiding me through it. You know, getting me into the meditation and giving me cues and what-not. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad to hear that I\u2019ve been helpful, but you shouldn\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself to do it on your own. You\u2019ve made so much progress in the last few months. That\u2019s enough for right now. ",
        "Sam: I know, I know that\u2019s what you said on Thursday. And I think that\u2019s what finally did it - instead of just sitting in my apartment, trying to force myself to meditate, I tried not to worry about it too much. I sort of assumed that it wouldn\u2019t happen, so I just did the meditation out of habit and didn\u2019t stress about it and it worked. I went away and I meant to. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s remarkable, Sam. You said you went to England?",
        "Sam: Yeah, for only a couple of minutes. It was strange- normally when I arrive in the other place, I never know when I\u2019m going to come back. Once I\u2019ve settled down from the journey getting there, I feel normal and I just wander around until I feel myself being pulled back to the present. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But this was different?",
        "Sam: Yes. It was like - like I had to hold on to being there or something. From the moment I got there, I felt like I was being pulled back. I had to concentrate really hard to stay, even for just a few minutes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think that is?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. Maybe because it was voluntary? I have the getting there part under control, but maybe I have to control every piece of it.",
        "Dr. Bright: I think you\u2019re probably right. Before, your trips were induced by panic. Now that you\u2019re learning to control it, you are fighting against what your body wants to do naturally. ",
        "Sam: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think the trips are your body\u2019s way of trying to calm down during a panic attack. When you\u2019re in emotional or physical turmoil, your body transports you to a different place that it deems safe. As if it's choosing flight over fight. ",
        "Sam: What, like a defense mechanism?",
        "Dr. Bright: I definitely think it\u2019s possible. It would explain why the lengths of the trips vary so much. You said the one after the accident was by far the longest - and it was after the greatest trauma you\u2019ve undergone. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, that\u2019s true. I\u2019d never really thought about it that way but yeah- the more anxious I was feeling the longer I would be gone. But I still don\u2019t get why that would affect my ability to go on trips on purpose.",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve been able to leave purposefully by entering into a calm, meditative state. When you go to another place in that condition, your body isn\u2019t using the travel as a defense mechanism. Instead, the trip is what disrupts the calm, not the other way around. So your body will try to pull itself back to the present and the calm state that you were experiencing there. ",
        "Sam: So I\u2019m basically just always trying to find calm. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think so. Our bodies crave balance. ",
        "Sam: You\u2019d think mine would have come up with a less weird way to accomplish that. ",
        "Dr. Bright:  Yes, I suppose it could have. But this is just a theory. The cause of your trips could be any number of things, or even a combination of things.",
        "Sam: Sure, right. But I think this makes sense. I mean, it also explains why I was able to come back before seeing the moment of the accident a few weeks ago. It was like my body was protecting me against having to watch that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s a very good point.",
        "Sam: So how on earth am I supposed to travel of my own free will if it just throws my body into chaos?",
        "Dr. Bright: When you arrived in England - when you realized that you had been successful in your attempts to travel - what did you feel?",
        "Sam: Excited. And proud that I was able to accomplish something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you nervous at all? Frightened?",
        "Sam: Um, yeah, I was a bit. I mean, it was such a new sensation. Getting it right, being able to control it. I guess- I guess I wasn\u2019t sure if it was entirely a good thing. I mean, what if controlling it means I can mess things up? What if I can get there but not get back? What if I get stuck somewhere forever?",
        "Dr. Bright: See why your body wanted to pull you back to the present? You were experiencing anxiety on a trip; not something that is typical, as I understand it. ",
        "Sam: But I\u2019ve had panic attacks on other trips before. And they\u2019ve never pulled me back. I only go back when I\u2019m fully calm. Or bored. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Has an attack on a trip ever been as bad as the attack that caused the trip in the first place?",
        "Sam: No, I guess not. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you\u2019ve said it yourself - you know you can\u2019t get hurt when you\u2019re in other times. There\u2019s less danger in the past than there is in the present. ",
        "Sam: But now that I can control it, that\u2019s not true. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Exactly. ",
        "Sam: So what do I do?",
        "Dr. Bright: We keep working on your anxiety. If you can learn to be less afraid, to be more confident in yourself and your abilities, then you should be able to control every aspect of the trips. ",
        "Sam: Okay. I guess that makes sense. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Let\u2019s get back to what happened yesterday. You went back to the same place in England?",
        "Sam: Oh, um, yes. Which is so weird. I mean, there have been a couple of repeats throughout the years, but never back to back like that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you thinking about the place before you went there?",
        "Sam: Yeah, I was. But this trip wasn\u2019t on purpose.",
        "Dr. Bright: It was anxiety induced?",
        "Sam: Yes, I was- well, I was thinking about getting stuck. I was thinking about maybe trying to go on a trip again, but I was caught up in worrying about it and then I left.",
        "Dr. Bright: And when you arrived, did you feel like you were being pulled back? Or was it one of your usual trips. ",
        "Sam: It felt pretty normal. I felt solid there. And I, you know, sort of rolled my eyes at the irony of ending up in the same place that I had failed to stay in before and then I went about my usual routine. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You mean finding someone interesting to follow around?",
        "Sam: Right. It was the early 1800s - Regency era, I think. I don\u2019t know, it reminded me of Jane Austen. My mom was a big fan of hers. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you?",
        "Sam: Um, I don\u2019t know. I remember liking her books when my mom used to read them to me, but I haven\u2019t read any fiction like that in years. It doesn\u2019t really- it doesn\u2019t hold a lot of appeal. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Too close to home?",
        "Sam: Something like that. I like science fiction, mostly movies and TV, though I\u2019ve read a few novels. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Science fiction, really? ",
        "Sam: You're surprised. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, I would have thought that would be especially too close to home. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, I don\u2019t like all science fiction - like, X-Men is definitely a little too relatable and I can\u2019t stand anything set in the present, but anything in the future or outer space is okay. At least I know I\u2019m unlikely to ever go to either of those places. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. I suppose that makes sense. And historical nonfiction is right out I assume?",
        "Sam: No, not at all. I mean, I have to do a lot of research for my job - or rather, I come across a lot of research, and then it\u2019s my job to archive it - but I like learning more about the places I go. It helps to put things in context. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But Jane Austen doesn\u2019t do it for you? Her novels are fairly true to the time period. ",
        "Sam: Well, sure, but it\u2019s- it\u2019s her characters. I don\u2019t, um, well, families and friendships and romance are not really things that I know a lot about. I\u2019d rather read a textbook on the 19th century than a romance novel about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand that. ",
        "Sam: It\u2019s just- not everyone experiences those things, you know? At least with a non-fiction book I know those things happened. It\u2019s fact. History is easy - things happen and they affect the world around them, either in a big way or a small way. And sometimes I get to see those things. But Mr. Darcy doesn\u2019t exist and there\u2019s no reason to believe that he could. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You like to stick to reality. ",
        "Sam: As much as I can. There\u2019s no point in fantasizing about things that will never happen. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Mr. Darcy may not exist, but other people do.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I guess. Speaking of which, um, I did find someone to follow around in England. A girl, a little younger than me, and her sister. I overheard them gossiping a few minutes after I got there and they seemed fun. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah. Very Austen. ",
        "Sam: I guess so. They were just walking around the main town, doing errands, talking to various people - some things are essentially the same no matter what time you\u2019re in. And then they started to head home and it was a pretty long walk, but it was nice. It was a nice day and it\u2019s always cool to see so much undisturbed countryside. And as we were walking through this field, there was a tree with a man sitting against it. He was about my age and I didn\u2019t think much of it, it looked like he had just stopped in the middle of a walk to take a nap or something but - well he was quite handsome, so I was looking at him a bit and his clothes - they were Regency clothes but they looked. I don\u2019t know, they looked odd on him. I couldn\u2019t place my finger on it, but he just looked so out of place. And I was expecting one of the girls to point him out, or, I don\u2019t know, whisper to one another about his looks - there had been a lot of that so far - but nothing. They didn\u2019t even seem to notice that he was there. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Perhaps they didn\u2019t see him.",
        "Sam: No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. We were walking straight towards him and they didn\u2019t glance at him once. And then - and this is what I was trying to say in the voicemail. Um, well, we were about thirty feet away and the girls\u2019 chatter woke him up I think and he opened his eyes, and he did sort of a double take and leaped up to his feet. And I thought that he was just trying to be polite - you know, stand in the presence of ladies and all that but, he looked shocked. And confused. And then- then I realized he was looking at me. I wasn\u2019t sure at first, but he looked straight into my eyes and I just- I stopped dead. The girls kept walking forwards, past him and he didn\u2019t look away from me once. He saw me. And I could feel it happening - my body pulling away, I guess because this was freaking me out way more than any anxiety I had had before coming on the trip - but before I left, he smiled. He looked me right in the eye, and the shock softened and he smiled. And I don\u2019t know, it was- it was extraordinary. I\u2019ve seen a lot of amazing things in my trips - a lot of bad stuff, yes, but also a lot of beautiful things. But this- this strange, out of place person smiling at me in the middle of a field is maybe the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at me and smiled like that. You know, not the vague, practiced smile of someone passing you on the street or handing you your change, it was- it was like he meant it. Like somehow my mere existence had made him happy. And I don\u2019t understand any piece of it - I mean, who is he? How did he get there? How is it that he was able to see me? But, I don't know, all of those questions don\u2019t seem so important when I think about sheer joy and wonder on his face. I didn\u2019t know I could make someone look like that.  Dr. Bright? Dr. Bright are you okay? You look a little pale.",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I\u2019m fine, thank you, Sam. ",
        "Sam: I know, it\u2019s pretty incredible. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, it is. And you\u2019re absolutely sure he was looking at you - not something behind you?",
        "Sam: I\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my entire life. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But he was wearing era clothing?",
        "Sam: Well, yes, but like I said, they were odd on him. And actually - he was sort of odd, too, not just the clothes. It was like - it was like he wasn\u2019t solid. I think he must have been another time traveler. But then how was he wearing the clothes? I mean, I can\u2019t pick anything up when I\u2019m in other times. How would he have put clothes on?",
        "Dr. Bright: What did he look like? Exactly?",
        "Sam: Why? Do you think he\u2019s one of the mental time travelers that you were talking about? Someone you\u2019ve read about?",

        "Dr. Bright: No, Sam. I- I didn\u2019t give you the whole picture when I told you I had read about other time travelers. I assume there are more out there, but I have only read about one. She was able to push her consciousness back in time, like I\u2019ve explained, but she passed away a few years ago. ",

        "Sam: And what would that be?",
        "Dr. Bright: There are people - atypicals - who are able to adapt and perform the abilities of other atypicals around them. They act as a sort of conduit - they do not have any special power on their own, but when in close proximity to someone who does, they are able to perform the same powers. ",

        "Sam: And you think he went missing to the 1800s?",
        "Dr. Bright: Not exactly. Sam- this puts me in a somewhat awkward position. There are some things that you don\u2019t know - a lot of things in fact - that could potentially put you in harm\u2019s way. But if that man really is who I think he is, then I know why he was able to see you. And I also know that you might be the only person who is able to help him. But you can leave my office right now and forget about all of this. You can continue to be my patient and I will help you with your anxiety so that you can live life as normally as possible. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Or I can tell you what I know and you can decide if you want to help me. But Sam, I am serious when I say that this will make your life even more complicated than it already is. You said yourself that you don\u2019t want any more adventures. ",

I need you to think long and hard about this before I tell you anything. I\u2019ll look at my notes, try and figure out the most concise way to catch you up on the last 10 years and if you still want to know on Monday, you will have a folder waiting for you that will explain everything. As well as the appropriate proof. I need you to believe me and sitting here hashing it out is only going to frustrate us both. ",

Adam\u2019s favorite band came out with, like, a new album, so we were listening to that. And you know, things were going well. Like, really well actually. At one point, I sort of thought that- well- ",

        "Caleb: Well, that something might, you know, might happen. But I don\u2019t know, there have been so many weird moments like that recently where I feel like I\u2019m looking at him a little bit too much but he\u2019s looking back and it\u2019s like maybe he feels the same way, but. Well, not that it fucking makes a difference now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Caleb: Because it was a disaster! An unmitigated disaster, to borrow a phrase from my former best friend. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, what happened?",
        "Caleb: So after we had finished listening to the album, I suggested that we go for a walk. It\u2019s been really warm this weekend, right? And, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t really want to have the conversation with him while my parents were in the house. So we went to this park just down the street and, well, I explained everything to him. And he just freaked out and ran off. ",
        "Dr. Bright: He left? Did he say anything to you first?",
        "Caleb: Yeah he went totally like, pale and weird, and then he was all, \u201coh god, I need to go home, I\u2019m sorry\u201d and he literally ran away. Like, it would be funny if it wasn't just so fucking tragic. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very sorry that he reacted that way, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I just don\u2019t get it. I mean, I wasn\u2019t expecting a parade or anything, but I thought he\u2019d at least stick around. I sort of thought he might even find it kind of, I don\u2019t know, like, cool. Like, people find superpowers hot, right? And I mean, what I can do is sort of a superpower. It's- it just wasn\u2019t how I saw things going. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It can be very upsetting when our expectations of someone aren\u2019t met. Sometimes people let us down. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. That\u2019s not new to me. I just- I didn\u2019t think Adam would be one of those people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Can you think of why he may have reacted that way?",
        "Caleb: Not really.",
        "Dr. Bright: Perhaps he\u2019s confused about what you meant. How exactly did you explain your ability?",
        "Caleb: Well, I started at the beginning. I asked him if he had heard about that fight last year that almost got me expelled, you know, the one that got me to come and see you, and he said that he did. That he was surprised I\u2019d beat a kid up because I always seemed so nice. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, that must have been good to hear. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it was. So I explained about how sometimes I get really angry when other people get angry and he sort of smiled and said that he noticed that. So I started to explain about how some people have too much empathy or that synesthesia thing you told me about. And he said, yeah, he\u2019d heard of that before. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s a good start. ",
        "Caleb: His parents are both doctors and he\u2019s like a sponge for information so that wasn\u2019t surprising. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, so he was on board up to that point - what changed?",
        "Caleb: Well, then I got into my thing. And at first he didn\u2019t believe me. He thought I was just trying to pull a prank or something. But I told him that, no, I can definitely feel the feelings of other people. And then he thought that I just meant like, normal empathy stuff. And he was like, \u201cgee, Caleb:, you might be hanging out with jocks too much if you think it\u2019s abnormal to notice other people's feelings\u201d, which sort of stung to be completely honest. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know he teases you about football sometimes, but it\u2019s unlike him to be cruel about it, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, definitely. He\u2019s sarcastic and stuff but he\u2019s never mean. At least not to me. But I could tell that he was just getting defensive. I mean, the moment I started talking about feeling other people\u2019s emotions, he started to feel really nervous. More nervous than I\u2019ve felt from him since the first day I asked him to eat lunch. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think he was nervous?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t- look, I don't know, because he thought I was pulling a prank? He hates pranks a lot and- But I told him I was being completely serious, and it wasn\u2019t a normal empathy thing, and that I could feel that he was nervous and then that made him angry so I told him that I could feel that he was angry too and then he asked if I\u2019ve always been able to feel everything he feels and I said yeah, his feelings are actually some of the the easiest for me to feel and that\u2019s when he freaked and left. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you haven\u2019t heard anything from him since?",
        "Caleb: No. I texted him earlier today but he hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve seen plenty of those stupid, fucking grey dots, but nothing.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you text him?",
        "Caleb: Just that it was shitty- that it was a shitty thing for him to storm off like that and that I\u2019d really like to talk to him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You berated him and asked to see him in the same text?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think maybe that wasn\u2019t the best tactic?",
        "Caleb: Hey, he\u2019s the one that ran away when I was really, you know, lik,e opened up or whatever you always say I should do and he- he- ",
        "Dr. Bright: He rejected you. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, he fucking rejected me! I shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to text him, he should be texting me right now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said you felt nervousness and anger from him after you told him - did you feel anything else?",
        "Caleb: Surprise, I guess. Which wasn\u2019t too surprising. But mostly anger towards the end. Although-",
        "Dr. Bright: Although?",
        "Caleb: It wasn\u2019t only the normal anger that he feels. It was also, I think he was embarrassed too. But what does he have to be embarrassed about? I was the one putting everything on the line. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said yourself that you felt guilty over the fact that he didn\u2019t know you could feel his emotions. You must have known that this was going to be hard for him. Do you think it\u2019s possible that he has some feelings that he would rather you didn\u2019t know about?",
        "Caleb: What do you mean? He tells me everything about his life, what would he have to be embarrassed about that I don\u2019t already know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, try to put yourself in his shoes. It doesn\u2019t sound like you got into a long discussion about the greater nuances of your ability, so in his mind, you know exactly how he feels about you. He probably thinks that you know about his romantic feelings and never said anything to him, essentially letting him down easy.",
        "Caleb: Oh shit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Indeed. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one who feels rejected right now, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Oh, god, yeah, no, no no...I mean, we never- we never talk about that stuff. Which I know is kind of weird for friends - to never talk about dating but. Well, a while ago, we were, like, watching Mad Max and he made some off-handed comment about how hot Tom Hardy is- or well, he clearly wanted it to be off-handed, but he was pretty nervous about it and I just kind of brushed it off. I mean, I made sure he knew I didn\u2019t care and everything but I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it either. Everyone at school has kind of always known that Adam was gay and I could tell it was something he just wanted to get out of the way, to like, make sure I knew, I guess. And I was still too distracted by balancing everything out at the time to really pay that much attention. Oh, god, I\u2019ve been such a fucking idiot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve been distracted. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but all this time I just assumed that because I could feel his butterflies and we had those moments that we were sort of on the same page. Because, I was on his page, but he- he has no idea! Of course, god, he has no idea at all. I don\u2019t think he even thinks that I\u2019m - well you know, that I don\u2019t mind that he\u2019s- that's he's a boy or- you know what I mean.",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve never had your own Tom Hardy moment with him?",
        "Caleb: No, Tom Hardy doesn\u2019t really do it for me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Who does?",
        "Caleb: Adam. I know that people are going to call me gay for liking him that way, but I don\u2019t think that I am. I mean, I\u2019m definitely not straight either, but- it just never really came up. Because the only person I think about that way is him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you ever given him any reason to think that?",
        "Caleb: Not even a little bit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Now do you think you can understand his reaction a little bit more?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. No, I definitely can. God, what am I gonna do? I know how he thinks about stuff - he is a worst case scenario kind of dude so he\u2019s probably thinking that I\u2019ve been making fun of his crush with my teammates or something. When he has no idea that I like him so much it overwhelms anything I\u2019m feeling from him.",
        "Dr. Bright: I think you should tell him that. Nothing is ruined, Caleb. You just need to communicate with him. What are you doing?",
        "[sfx: phone opening]",
        "Caleb: Communicating. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I meant in person, or a phone call. Not texting. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Very well. ",
        "Caleb: Okay. I\u2019m saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I upset you yesterday but you need to know that I like your feelings. All of them. So you shouldn\u2019t feel weird or anything about the fact that I can feel them. Because it doesn\u2019t have to be weird\u201d. How\u2019s that?",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re going to send it regardless of what I have to say about better forms of communication, aren\u2019t you?",
        "[sfx: text sending]",
        "Caleb: Yep. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright, well, if there\u2019s nothing else you want to talk about with Adam, why don\u2019t we move on to school. You have finals coming up, correct?",
        "Caleb: What are you doing?",
        "Dr. Bright: Therapy. ",
        "Caleb: We can\u2019t move on from this. I have to wait to see what he says. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course, we\u2019ll come back to it once he responds. But who knows when that will be, so we may as well delve into some other subjects. ",
        "Caleb: Well, if it takes him more than a few minutes to respond then I can assume our friendship and any hope of something more is dead. So then we can talk about that. You\u2019re confused. That\u2019s a weird emotion coming from you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, sorry, I just- I don\u2019t think I especially understand the nuances of text etiquette. ",

        "Caleb: What do you mean?",
        "Adam: What feelings would you have to be confused about?",

        "Caleb: I like you too, okay? Yeah, I could feel something from you but I was never sure because I was always feeling it too. A lot. So you can stop being an idiot and feeling embarrassed because if anyone should feel embarrassed it\u2019s me, the guy who has been so stupid about you that it broke my fucking superpower. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Patient #13-A-3, session 7. Due to the patient\u2019s telepathy, our sessions are now focused on honing her ability, though we occasionally talk on the phone if there is a pressing personal matter. After the past few weeks of phone conversations, I think we have been able to rebuild a certain amount of trust. I am hopeful that she might now consider helping me when Agent Green comes for our meeting next week. While I do have reservations about getting her tangled up in all of this, I think she might be able to access some vital information. ",

        "Dr. Bright: How are you doing today?",
        "Chloe: Really great. I think Frank and I made a breakthrough. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Really? That\u2019s wonderful. Tell me about it. ",
        "Chloe: Well, like I told you on the phone, we\u2019ve been going to that art therapy place that you recommended. I signed up to volunteer at their open house and Frank has been willing to go as long as I\u2019m there. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, from what you\u2019ve told me, it sounds like he\u2019s really beginning to trust you. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I think he is. I think he was a bit confused at first - I mean, I guess it was a little strange for some random college student to take an interest in him - but once we started talking about his art, he got more comfortable around me.",
        "Dr. Bright:  And he didn\u2019t find it strange that you knew he was an artist?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t think so. I told him I could just tell and that made him happy. He started thinking about his grandmother - I guess she was an artist too. Not professionally or anything, but she used to tell him that \u201cyou can always tell a painter by what they look at\u201d. I don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s supposed to mean - I guess it\u2019s just one of those things that grandmas say - but I think I reminded him of her a little bit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that something he told you or something you heard in his thoughts?",
        "Chloe: I heard it. He doesn\u2019t talk about his family very much. Why have you changed your mind?",
        "Dr. Bright:  I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Chloe: About me helping Frank - your thinking about him is different now. Before you didn\u2019t think it was a good idea but now- it\u2019s like you\u2019re happy that I\u2019m spending time with him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right - I was hesitant at first. But I think this relationship has been good for you. Because Frank\u2019s thoughts are so fractured, you have to work twice as hard to understand them. I think this has made parsing through the thoughts of everyone else easy by comparison. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, that makes sense. Things have been getting easier. Even with Frank, I feel like I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. The painting has been making him a lot calmer and that makes it easier to hear him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How are his hands doing?",
        "Chloe: They\u2019re doing okay. I\u2019m still not totally sure if it\u2019s a physical injury or something related to his PTSD, but they still shake quite a bit. He\u2019s getting used to holding a paintbrush again, and I think he\u2019ll get there eventually. And yes, he\u2019s staying at the VA now and I think they\u2019re gonna help him get back on his feet. I think that\u2019s helping a lot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m still not quite used to you answering my questions before I even ask them.",
        "Chloe: Sorry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, it\u2019s perfectly alright. ",
        "Chloe: You don\u2019t understand it, do you?",
        "Dr. Bright: Understand what?",
        "Chloe: Why I would use my power like this. You\u2019re thinking about how if you had the power to read minds, you probably wouldn\u2019t use it to help a homeless artist. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, yes, I suppose that\u2019s true. ",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s nice that you think of him that way really - as an artist. I think he would like that. He never wanted to be in the Marines, you know. But his dad was, so Frank decided to try and make him proud by joining up. He actually ended up liking it in the end. But then his dad got really sick and Frank went to go take care of him after he was discharged and that\u2019s when things started to get bad. I think taking care of his dad had given him a purpose - something to focus on; distract him from thinking about the war. And so when his dad died, Frank\u2019s whole life unraveled. And yes, this is all stuff that I\u2019ve heard in his thoughts, not from him directly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, I wasn\u2019t just thinking about asking. ",
        "Chloe: I know. But you would have. It\u2019s an important question. I know I\u2019ve completely crossed a line now - digging into someone\u2019s thoughts to find out more about them it\u2019s, well, it\u2019s a huge invasion of privacy, I get that. But it does relate to his art at least- not that that\u2019s an excuse, I guess. But I went looking for the art and found his family history. I wasn\u2019t trying to dig his skeletons up. ",
        "Dr. Bright: His family is the subject of his art - paintings, correct?",
        "Chloe: Yes, it\u2019s a series. Seven paintings depicting seven different pieces of his life - important pieces. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Would you mind describing them to me? I understand if you\u2019re not comfortable with that; if you feel it violates Frank\u2019s privacy to share. ",
        "Chloe: No, that\u2019s alright. I know you\u2019re not interested in the finer details of his life. Or even the art, really. You want to know how well I see these things in his thoughts, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, that\u2019s it exactly. ",
        "Chloe: Well, then to answer your real question: I don\u2019t see the paintings perfectly clearly. It\u2019s more that I see the colors, the way Frank wants to paint - you know, the intention behind the brushstrokes, the emotion that he\u2019d be putting into it. Like, the first one is blues and greens and it\u2019s soft and comforting. I think that\u2019s the one with the lilies I\u2019ve been seeing. I think it\u2019s for his grandmother. She\u2019s the only person he really thinks of fondly. Well, her and his unit. And he misses her a lot so the painting is kind of bittersweet. But gentle.",
        "Dr. Bright: Are all his paintings that gentle? Focused on happier times?",
        "Chloe: No, not at all. The one about his unit is kind of fond, but more aggressive than the one with the lilies. Most of them are dark and angry. Big, violent brushstrokes, a lot of splatter painting. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Like Jackson Pollack?",
        "Chloe: Yes, exactly. But sharper somehow. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And these paintings are about the war I assume?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, mostly. There are three of them specifically about the war, I think. Well, one about his unit and then two others, maybe?",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re not sure?",
        "Chloe: Well, they\u2019re really similar and they\u2019re right in the middle of the series, so they sort of blur together. But the intentions behind them are a little different. One is when he got injured - it\u2019s pain, pure pain, and it\u2019s physical pain. When he thinks about that one it\u2019s like he wants to claw at the canvas, stab it with his brush. I think he was shot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And the other one?",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s more of an emotional pain. Still sand and blood but, I think maybe he lost a friend? It\u2019s really confused - some of the pain is his, some of it is his units\u2019, and then there\u2019s just the general chaos of the war. The violence is still there but it isn\u2019t in his body as much, if that makes sense. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It does. ",
        "Chloe: That one\u2019s the worst I think. Sometimes I\u2019ll hear him thinking about it and I\u2019ll wish for the loud pain of the other one. Which sounds crazy but it\u2019s just-",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. ",
        "Chloe: You\u2019re thinking about your brother again. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Sometimes losing someone we love can be more painful than any physical trials we experience. ",
        "Chloe: But he\u2019s not completely lost, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I don\u2019t think he is. In fact, I think I may be able to get him back. ",
        "Chloe: What does that have to do with me? I heard you thinking about me and helping him but I don\u2019t understand. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, your ability - your gift - it could help me save my brother. I know you don\u2019t like to use it to get the upper hand on people but I was hoping you could make an exception. ",
        "Chloe: You want me to listen to someone. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Chloe: An Agent Green? You want me to spy on what- a cop?",
        "Dr. Bright: No, he\u2019s not a cop exactly. He works for an organization that monitors people like you - people with special abilities. ",
        "Chloe: The AM. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve heard of it?",
        "Chloe: No, you were thinking-",
        "Dr. Bright: Right, of course. Sorry I just - normally I would not encourage a patient to look into this organization. They can put people like you in great danger. ",
        "Chloe: But they already know about me. That\u2019s who you were telling about me - not your recorder - but these dangerous people. Why would you do that?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t have a choice. If I didn\u2019t report to them on my patients, they would just take them into custody. Believe it or not, these sessions are protecting you. ",
        "Chloe: You may believe that, but I don\u2019t. If I hadn\u2019t come to you in the first place, they wouldn\u2019t even know about me. ",
        "Dr. Bright:  That\u2019s not exactly true. ",
        "Chloe: My mom? They know about her?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes.",
        "Chloe: But she doesn\u2019t see you and she doesn\u2019t seem to be in danger.",
        "Dr. Bright: Her ability protects her. Telekinetics are a dime a dozen at The AM. Telepaths however- ",
        "Chloe: That\u2019s why my mom sent me to you. So I could be an outpatient? What does that mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: The AM has a few levels of atypical observation. There are those who are held prisoner by the organization, experimented on - those people tend to have very valuable and strong abilities. Then there are those who are brought in by the organization and then let go - like a rehab center. These are people with pyrokinesis, invisibility, enhanced empathy, certain kinds of prescience or psychic ability - basically anything that the government either has no use for or something they can already do through technology. ",
        "Chloe:The government has psychic technology? ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, not exactly. But, for whatever reason, The AM still has a hard time believing in mediums and precognates, despite all the other extraordinary things they\u2019ve seen. ",
        "Chloe: Okay, so where do you fit into all of this?",
        "Dr. Bright: Those atypicals that are brought in and then released - those are outpatients. Once they are through their initial program at The AM, they are sent to me - or others like me - who can help them with the day to day struggles that they encounter as a result of their abilities. ",
        "Chloe: And then you report on them? To an organization you hate. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s not a perfect system, but it keeps The AM out of my patients\u2019 hair and they are able to live mostly normal lives. ",
        "Chloe: But I was never brought in by any organization. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019ve been monitored since you were a child. ",
        "Chloe: What? And my mother knew. She was the one who told you.",
        "Dr. Bright: Part of me feels as though I should just sit here and think and let you sort it all out. ",
        "Chloe: Sorry, I\u2019m just - this is a lot to take in and, as always, you are thinking very fast and it\u2019s a little overwhelming. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You were about 10 years old when I met your mother. ",
        "Chloe: But you never met me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I didn\u2019t. But your mother told me about you. She said that The AM had checked in every year, on your birthday, inquiring about any powers you may have displayed. And every year she said no. They - and your mother - assumed that if you had a power, you would be telekinetic. Most abilities are genetic. I actually have a theory that-",
        "Chloe: No, I\u2019m sorry, I can hear your thoughts trailing off into science land, but I don\u2019t care about that right now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. Vanessa- your mother thought that you were perfectly normal. Her telekinesis appeared when she was a child so she thought you were in the clear. The moment she suspected you might have an ability, she called me. She knew The AM would want to snatch you up. ",
        "Chloe: God, you mean that literally. But if I have such a high-value power as you\u2019ve been thinking, then why doesn\u2019t The AM want to take me now?",
        "Dr. Bright: They already have a number of telepaths actually. The danger with your power is not the ability itself, but the misuse of it. When a telepath starts displaying symptoms, The AM tries to get them off the streets as soon as possible. Otherwise, a telepath who is confused about their ability or doesn\u2019t know how to control it - as you once were - could unintentionally reveal their power to the general public. And that is The AM\u2019s greatest fear - they thrive on secrecy. So most of their work with outpatients is about maintaining that secrecy. They teach them how to use their abilities, get them to sign an agreement that they will not use their powers in front of others, and monitor them to make sure they aren\u2019t breaking any rules. ",
        "Chloe: So, anyone with an ability is basically treated like a criminal?",
        "Dr. Bright: They don\u2019t frame it like that - they try to explain to atypicals that it is in their best interest to keep their powers a secret. Appeal to images of villagers with pitchforks and what-not. ",
        "Chloe: That used to be your job. You used to work for them, and that\u2019s what you did. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. I thought it was good work that I was doing-",
        "Chloe: You still do. Think that I mean. And, well, it seems like you still do that kind of work. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right- I do still think that it\u2019s good work - keeping an eye on atypicals protects everyone. And in my own private practice, I am able to help my patients. But The AM often has less than noble intentions.",
        "Chloe: They have your brother. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Chloe: Because he\u2019s powerful. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes.",
        "Chloe: And you want me to listen to Agent Green\u2019s thoughts to find out about what they\u2019re doing to him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Chloe: Okay.",
        "Dr. Bright: What? Chloe I don\u2019t expect-",
        "Chloe: No, I want to.  I don\u2019t love the idea of spying on someone but- while you\u2019ve been talking about them, you\u2019ve been thinking about the experiments they do. Seeing them in your head, it\u2019s just like watching what goes on in Frank\u2019s head. I\u2019m so tired of seeing people get hurt. If I can do something to help stop that, I will. I mean, I\u2019ll talk it over with my mom first. It seems like she\u2019s been leaving a lot of stuff out of our conversations. But this seems like the right thing to do.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Thank you, Chloe. I admire your bravery. I know this is crossing the line of doctor and patient so I think it would be best if you stopped seeing me in a formal capacity. You could still come in, and I want you to, but it would be pro bono on my part. I would be a resource for you, not your therapist. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, that sounds good.",
        "Dr. Bright: Good. I have a meeting with Agent Green next Friday. I was thinking you could sit in the waiting room and listen to his thoughts. I\u2019ll ask some questions to make sure he thinks about Mark. The whole meeting shouldn\u2019t be long. Green is my liaison with The AM - he checks in a few times a year to get updated on my research and any new patients. ",
        "Chloe: Isn\u2019t that a bit of a conflict of interest?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",

        "Dr. Bright: Oh, I didn\u2019t realize I was thinking about that-",

        "Chloe: Right. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, uh, let\u2019s practice a bit. Why don\u2019t you go sit out in the waiting room and we\u2019ll use the intercom to do the numbers exercise. ",

        "Sam: But my body comes with me. That\u2019s why I had to sleep and he didn\u2019t. He said he never gets tired or hungry - he can\u2019t smell things like I can. And that\u2019s why he was wearing old clothes - era clothes. He\u2019s able to kind of imagine it. It\u2019s what the other time traveler used to do when they would go on trips. Part of the mental deal I guess. The clothes faded after she died, but he was able to get them back after a year or so of trying. He said he was really relieved. He was getting sick of looking down at hospital scrubs all the time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So he has some measure of control over it? Just when I think I have a handle on how Class D powers work-",
        "Sam: I know, you and me both. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why have you not mentioned these physical needs before?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about. I\u2019ve never had to think about how my ability works because I've never been able to control it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But how have you survived? Some of your trips have been far longer than a human should go without food or water.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I know. You\u2019re clearly rubbing off on me, because I actually have a theory, for once. I do get hungry - and thirsty - but I think my body enters a sort of stasis when I travel. I don\u2019t get tired as quickly - I only need sleep every few days - and I don\u2019t get really hungry until about a week or so has gone by. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The traveling slows down your metabolism. ",
        "Sam: I think so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But what about water? Surely your system doesn\u2019t slow down so much that you can go a month without water.",
        "Sam: Precipitation.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Sam: In the trenches - my longest trip - it rained all the time. I can\u2019t pick things up, but sometimes things directed at me still has an effect. Not much of one, but I can usually feel a little something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So when it rains or snows...",
        "Sam: I just stick out my tongue. And my body also absorbs a lot of moisture I think. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But what if it doesn\u2019t rain?",
        "Sam: I find a lake or river or a big fountain in a pinch. Anything that I can submerge myself in. I\u2019ve never been on a trip where I couldn\u2019t find some source of water, thankfully. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And other things that are directed at you?",
        "Sam: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, if someone, say, threw a frisbee towards you - or fired a gun - what would happen?",
        "Sam: It goes straight through me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But can you feel it?",
        "Sam: Well, I don\u2019t know about a frisbee but a bullet, yeah, I can feel it. It doesn\u2019t seem to have a real affect on me, but I can feel it.",
        "Dr. Bright: See what I mean? You are incredibly resilient. ",
        "Sam: Sure, but I would never survive two years on a trip. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I suppose it\u2019s a blessing that Mark was working with a mental time traveler then. ",
        "Sam: I guess so. Though if he\u2019d been working with someone like me, The AM wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill the atypical in the present and leave him there. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Very true. Sam - are you afraid of The AM? You can walk away at any time if you feel the risk is too large.",
        "Sam: I\u2019ve spent my whole life afraid, it\u2019s nothing new. I\u2019m not going to walk away. Even before talking to him, I could have never lived with myself if I let someone rot in the past like that. Now that I have talked to him, well, I want to get him out as much as you do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: He really made an impression on you, didn\u2019t he?",
        "Sam: Um, yeah. Yeah, he did. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you two talk about?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know, lots of things. It\u2019s funny, he was sort of stuck in an 1810 mode of speaking for a bit - very stiff, very formal. I get that - after the trench trip, everything sounded like German to me. I kept saying \u201cdanke\u201d to people who were bringing me grief casseroles. But, anyway, the more we talked, the more he started to speak like he was actually from the 21st century. It was really cute- his eyes would light up every time I used slang or an abbreviation or something. So I spent some time just catching him up on all the new terms and shorthands. He was not pleased that \u201cYOLO\u201d was a thing, but he seemed to like \u201cbae\u201d quite a bit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You too talked about internet slang? You both were defying the known laws of the universe by existing 200 years ago and you were talking about the merits of the word \u201cbae\u201d?",
        "Sam: Well, yeah. He wanted to know what he\u2019d missed. We did talk about time travel though - I mean, it was the natural ice-breaker. We swapped stories, he told me a little bit about his partner - the other time traveler. Her name was Camille. He misses her a lot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: He does?",
        "Sam: Why does that surprise you?",
        "Dr. Bright: I wouldn\u2019t think he would be fond of anyone in The AM. ",
        "Sam: Well, no, he\u2019s definitely not. But she was in the same boat as him. They were both prisoners. You know, comrades in arms. I think he looked up to her as a kind of mentor.",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. ",
        "Sam: Don\u2019t worry, he hasn\u2019t replaced his big sister. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did he- did he talk about me at all?",
        "Sam: A little. I mean, we went through all the basic bio stuff, where we grew up, went to school, and he mentioned he had an older sister. That you were the one who first figured out what his power was. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was he surprised when you told him you knew me?",
        "Sam: Um, I didn\u2019t actually get around to that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What? Why not?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know, it never seemed like the right moment. He clearly didn\u2019t want to talk about his family and I didn\u2019t really didn't want to talk about mine, so I just let the conversation move on. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, you need to tell him you\u2019re working with me. He needs to know that I\u2019m doing everything I can to get him back.  ",
        "Sam: I know, I know, I will. But I don\u2019t want to get his hopes up. What if I can\u2019t figure it out? What if I can go back and visit him and nothing else?",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand that fear, Sam, I do. But I believe in you. I would never have approached you about helping me if I didn\u2019t think you could do it. ",
        "Sam: That\u2019s not true. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Sam: I think we both know you would try anything at least once. You\u2019ve been working on this for years and you\u2019ve never been close. You said that yourself. You were willing to tell me everything - to tell that other patient of yours, the mind reader, everything - without knowing either of us for very long. I think you would have brought me in on this even if there was only a one in one hundred chance that I could help. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right. Though to be fair, it wasn\u2019t entirely my choice to tell my other patient everything. She is a mind reader after all. ",
        "Sam: Okay, fair enough. She sounds awesome. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Would you like to meet her?",
        "Sam: What? Really?",
        "Dr. Bright: I can ask her about it. She has become curious about other atypicals after running into one at my office. I know she\u2019d be interested in meeting other people like her. And I think it would be good for you as well. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, that would be great actually. Probably, I don't know, a little weird, probably. But good. ",
        "Dr. Bright: If you\u2019ll allow me a therapist moment, you\u2019ve been isolated for very long. I know it\u2019s likely you never would have come back to see me if you had someone else in your life who knew your secret-",
        "Sam: Dr. Bright-",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: Yeah, I guess so. But I don\u2019t feel that way now. These past few weeks - well, ever since you filled me in, it\u2019s been, fun? Okay, so that\u2019s not the right word, but I don\u2019t know, I don't feel so tense being around another person anymore. Talking to you, trying to figure it all out, it\u2019s been- it's been a nice change. I mean, yes, I would like more friends. Any friends. But talking to Mark was- well it was fun, the most fun I\u2019ve had in my entire life, maybe. I mean, I\u2019ve never met anyone who actually understood what it was like to be me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And I can\u2019t ever understand it. Despite all my knowledge and research, I\u2019ll never truly understand what it\u2019s like to be an atypical. Even though your powers are very different, you and Chloe would be able to relate, I think. ",
        "Sam: Chloe - that\u2019s the mind reader?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. She\u2019s very easy to get along with actually - she uses her power to understand people, empathize with them. It\u2019s very nice. ",
        "Sam: Not how you would use it, I\u2019m guessing?",
        "Dr. Bright: Um, no. Probably not. ",
        "Sam: See, this is what I mean. Now that you\u2019re more honest with me I\u2019m actually starting to like you. I guess I have a soft spot for the Brights. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I appreciate the sentiment, Sam. But as we\u2019ve established, I am not like my brother. I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes that he would not be proud of. Working for the organization that kidnapped him would be a big one.",
        "Sam: Sure, but he seems like the forgiving sort. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I hope so. Either way, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s met you now. He\u2019ll have a friend when he\u2019s back in the world. I know he may not want to talk to me- ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not-",
        "Dr. Bright: No, trust me. He saw me at The AM. He will be very angry. If there\u2019s one thing we do share, it\u2019s our stubbornness. I know I\u2019ve already asked a lot of you.",
        "Sam: It\u2019s okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: If he doesn\u2019t want to see me when he comes back, will you keep an eye on him? I\u2019m not asking you to spy for me or anything, you don\u2019t have to ever speak to me again either if you don\u2019t want, but just make sure that he\u2019s okay. I know you\u2019ll be able to ease him back into things. Help him readjust.",
        "Sam: I think you\u2019d be able to help him too. You know, you\u2019re not a bad therapist when you don\u2019t have an ulterior motive. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Just promise me, Sam. ",
        "Sam: OK. I promise. So what next?",
        "Dr. Bright: We keep working on your ability. You\u2019ve been able to go on a fair number of trips on purpose, now it\u2019s just about hitting the target. ",
        "Sam: But even if I manage to go to where he is on purpose, and stay there, how do I get him back? We can\u2019t touch. He tried to shake my hand and it just went right through.",
        "Dr. Bright: I think I have a theory. Relating to the water exception that seems to exist. ",
        "Sam: God, that was fast. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m going to have to do some more research on dimensions, I think. Maybe call in a favor at The AM...",
        "Sam: What? Is that a good idea?",
        "Dr. Bright: Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t mention you. But I need more information. The AM has conducted a lot of research on Class D abilities and we may be able to apply some of it to you even if you are a unique case. ",
        "Sam: Okay. If you\u2019re sure. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Anything is worth a try. ",
        "Sam: I think we\u2019ll agree to disagree on that. ",

Most were reporting normally and there have only been 6 new patients this quarter across the board. Asset 17 is recommending one of their patients for our Tier 1 program. It is a young patient with super-strength and her parents are concerned about the child accidentally hurting herself or her siblings. I will be asking Tier 1 if they have availability and if so, I will be recommending her for the two week program. That should be enough to help her settle into her powers without making her miss too much school. ",

I need to follow up with Asset 43 about two of her patients - a Class D that I failed to get details on and a Class E that I want more information on. It is unlike Asset 43 to mis-categorize a patient so I am not convinced that this subject is a psychic as she claims. It doesn't fit into the Class E category.

We have a number of programs that may be of interest to you - private sessions to teach you how to live your life with your ability, seminars discussing the best ways to tell your family and friends, job counseling. We\u2019ll even help you find employment if you have an ability that hinders you from appearing in public. ",
        "Damien: I appear in public just fine, thanks. ",

        "Agent Green: Have you ever been hospitalized, Mr. Damien? Ever needed any kind of serious medical procedure? No? That\u2019s how you would benefit. Your biology is fundamentally different from everyone else - most medical professionals really wouldn't know what to do with you. Or, worse, they would do something and it would create a terrible chain reaction that could lead to your death. If you\u2019re registered with us, we will get a notification from any hospital that admits you and we will be able to provide the necessary medical information to get you your proper help. When was the last time you had a physical? We can provide healthcare, free mental health counseling - which I take it you are already benefitting from - and dozens of other resources that you can\u2019t find anywhere else. Think of it as being part of an exclusive club. You join, you get perks. You don\u2019t and you take unnecessary risk. You\u2019re a healthy young man right now, Damien, but you will age, like everyone, and mental abilities like yours don\u2019t always hold up in advanced aging - we\u2019ve seen serious deterioration from some of our older patients in your category. Wouldn\u2019t it be best to not have to face that all alone?",

        "Damien: I bet I know her better. ",

        "Chloe: Yeah, sometimes. But it also makes carrying on conversation kind of hard. So now if I\u2019m talking to someone, I record the conversation, so I can listen back and piece it together with the thoughts I was hearing from them while we were talking. ",
        "Sam: Oh. Wow, that\u2019s a really good idea. ",
        "Chloe: Dr. Bright seems full of those. Or- ideas at least. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re always good ones. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, she\u2019s, well, she\u2019s kind of intense, right? I mean, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time together recently as, I don't know, time travel vigilantes? And she never seems to switch her brain off. I know for a fact that right now she\u2019s sorting through a mountain of dimensional research trying to figure out how I occupy space in the past, or something. ",
        "Chloe: Wow, and you think mind reading is cool? I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty amazing. ",
        "Sam: It\u2019s starting to be, I think. I mean, it was amazing at first, all those years ago. But then, well, the trips got really hard and started happening all the time, and it became a part of my life that I just didn\u2019t want to participate in anymore. ",
        "Chloe: Why? Oh. Oh, that\u2019s awful, I\u2019m so sorry, Sam. ",
        "Sam: Did you just read my thoughts?",
        "Chloe: Uh, yes. Yeah, I did. Sorry. ",
        "Sam: No, no, it's- it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s actually nice to have someone know without having to go through the whole terrible story again. This is kind of weird, right? I mean, do you know other people like us? Other atypicals?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, a few. ",
        "Sam: Really? How?",
        "Chloe: Well, it\u2019s genetic a lot of the time, apparently. So, I got my power from my mom. She\u2019s not a telepath - she\u2019s a telekinetic. ",
        "Sam: Oh, neat. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, she\u2019s really great. She\u2019s got the most perfect control over her power - better than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. ",
        "Sam: Who are the others?",
        "Chloe: Well, there\u2019s that other patient of Dr. Bright\u2019s. Damien? Yeah, he\u2019s a piece of work. ",
        "Sam: Dr. Bright has mentioned him. She says she might need to use him to help Mark but that I am under no circumstances to ever talk to him. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, that\u2019s good advice. I\u2019ve met him a few times - our powers don\u2019t work on each other - and never seeing his face again would be too soon. ",
        "Sam: He\u2019s really that bad, huh?",
        "Chloe: He\u2019s just creepy. Like, I know that he\u2019s potentially really dangerous because of what he can do, but he doesn\u2019t seem to actually use it for very much. And it\u2019s so frustrating talking to him. I\u2019ve gotten kind of used to interacting with people when I can hear their thoughts and it\u2019s really annoying not having my footing with someone, you know?",
        "Sam: Not really. I\u2019ve never felt like I have my footing. Interacting with people isn\u2019t exactly a strength of mine. Or something I enjoy. Or even something I really ever do. ",
        "Chloe: This is going okay, though, right?",
        "Sam: Yeah, yeah, I mean, there\u2019s less pressure than there was before. I\u2019m not so worried anymore that I\u2019m going to disappear at any moment and, well, talking to a mind reader is actually kind of great. Because if I say something wrong, or can\u2019t think of anything to say, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m trying to say. Does that make sense? ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, I think so. You\u2019ve never really had friends before.",
        "Sam: Is it that obvious?",
        "Chloe: No, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to be blunt. I\u2019m just, you know, listening. ",
        "Sam: Right. Uh, yeah, I think the last time I was out for coffee with someone was freshman year?",
        "Chloe: Of college?",
        "Sam: Of high school. ",
        "Chloe: Whoa. ",
        "Sam: Yeah. ",
        "Chloe: Wait, who\u2019s the guy in your head right now? He looks familiar.",
        "Sam: What?",
        "Chloe: You\u2019re thinking of a new friend maybe? Or wait, no- oh sorry, is this a fantasy?",
        "Sam: What? No, no, god-",
        "Chloe: Sorry, I just thought- with the old fashioned clothes-",
        "Sam: No, no, that\u2019s-",
        "Chloe: Oh, that\u2019s Mark! ",
        "Sam: Shh. ",
        "Chloe: Sorry. That\u2019s Dr. Bright\u2019s brother - that\u2019s why he looks familiar. Oh, he is cute. I\u2019d always wondered.",
        "Sam: But if you saw him in Dr. Bright\u2019s head?",
        "Chloe: Right, yeah, I did, but it was the way that she perceives him. So he was a bit younger and I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t tell if he was handsome or not because it\u2019s not exactly like Dr. Bright sees her brother that way. ",
        "Sam: So people\u2019s perceptions of things shape the way you see them? Hear them?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, of course. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re basically the same in person as you are in Dr. Bright\u2019s head. ",
        "Sam: Oh, that\u2019s good.",
        "Chloe: I think so. So what\u2019s he like?",
        "Sam: Who? Mark?",
        "Chloe: Yeah. I can\u2019t even imagine what another Bright would be like.",
        "Sam: He\u2019s- you were right, before. I do consider him kind of a new friend. I mean, I\u2019ve only gone back four times and the first time I came back before I was even able to speak to him, but he\u2019s- he\u2019s really charming. And funny. And smart. ",
        "Chloe: He understands you. ",
        "Sam: Yeah. How-",
        "Chloe: Telepath, remember?",
        "Sam: Right. I\u2019m not like you. My parents weren\u2019t different as far as I know and, well, even if they were...",
        "Chloe: Yeah. ",
        "Sam: I\u2019ve been alone a long time. It\u2019s hard to connect with people when you\u2019ve got this huge thing standing in the way. Even now that I\u2019ve got it under control a little bit, it\u2019s still- well, I\u2019m just used to being a certain way, you know? And Mark gets that. He knows what it\u2019s like to be trapped in the past. To have no control over your own body. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to unload all of that on you. There aren\u2019t a lot of people I can talk to about this kind of stuff. I never know when I\u2019m going to see Mark and Dr. Bright is kind of laser-focused on the mission now so...",
        "Chloe: Well, that\u2019s why she wanted you to meet me right? So I could be a sympathetic ear.",
        "Sam: She told you that?",
        "Chloe: No, no, I heard it just now. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not doing this as a favor or out of pity or anything. I wanted to meet you too. And despite what you\u2019re thinking, it hasn't always been easy for me either. Yes, my ability makes it easier for me to connect with people, but only now that I have some amount of control over it. Before it was like having a constant crowd in my head. I thought I was going crazy. And then I thought I was hearing angels and everyone else thought I was going crazy.",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Chloe: No, I\u2019m not trying to make you feel bad. I\u2019m just saying, you\u2019re not alone. There\u2019s me and my mom and Caleb and I think a bunch of other people too who understand what it\u2019s like to have something going on in your body that you can\u2019t explain. ",
        "Sam: Who\u2019s Caleb?",
        "Chloe: Oh, he\u2019s the other atypical I know. He\u2019s an empath - he feels other people\u2019s feelings - so we really get each other, you know? I met him a few weeks ago and we\u2019ve gotten to know each other a bit. He\u2019s still in high school but he\u2019s pretty cool. He\u2019s actually going to come volunteer with me at this art therapy place I work at sometimes. ",
        "Sam: Oh, you\u2019re an artist?",
        "Chloe: Yeah, it\u2019s my major currently. But I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m thinking about maybe switching to social work. Or doubling, who knows. Oh, and no, I\u2019m not going to art therapy myself. I have a friend who was in the war and I\u2019ve been taking him. It seems like it\u2019s been helping with his PTSD. I don\u2019t know if it would help with you. I mean, your war experience has been so different, but maybe it\u2019s worth a try? You\u2019re more than welcome to come, I\u2019m sure Caleb and Frank would both love to meet you. Oh, sorry. That was a lot to dump on you at once, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: I, um, yeah, wow that\u2019s-",
        "Chloe: This is why the recorder helps. Sometimes I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m having a whole conversation with someone without them saying a word.",
        "Sam: Right. It's okay. Um, thank you. For inviting me, that is. That\u2019s really nice of you. ",
        "Chloe: No problem. You\u2019re not going to come, are you?",
        "Sam: It sounds like maybe a bit too much for me right now. ",
        "Chloe: Sure, of course. No pressure. ",
        "Sam: So, is Frank an atypical too?",
        "Chloe: No. Well. No. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s strange, but ever since getting to know Caleb - seeing inside his head, what feeling other peoples\u2019 emotions is like- well, sometimes I see similar stuff in Frank\u2019s thoughts. Which isn\u2019t unheard of. You know, everyone is on the spectrum of empathy or whatever and sometimes people are just naturally more empathetic than others but with Frank it\u2019s so strong sometimes. And I didn\u2019t really know what it was at first, but now that I\u2019ve gotten used to the way he thinks and I\u2019m seeing how Caleb thinks about his ability, the two seem related in some way. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m probably reading a bit too much into it. Frank has a lot going on in his head and sometimes I can\u2019t see the trees for the forest, you know?",
        "Sam: Not really, sorry. ",
        "Chloe: No, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m babbling.",
        "Sam: So, if he\u2019s not special, how did you get to know Frank?",
        "Chloe: Well, he is special, to me anyway, even if he\u2019s not like us. It\u2019s okay, I know you didn\u2019t mean it that way. But he\u2019s- I mean, he\u2019s been through a lot, so I guess I sort of felt bad for him when I first saw his thoughts but now it\u2019s- he\u2019s a really good guy. And he\u2019s such an amazing artist. I mean, he\u2019s still not painting that much because he has this issue with his hands, but we sit there for hours and he describes these paintings to me and I\u2019m his hands. He\u2019s able to do some of the less specific brush work and I take care of the details. And he\u2019s been so happy with the result so far. I mean, he has no idea that the reason they\u2019re coming out so well is because I can see them in perfect living color in his head, but every time I get something right or he finishes describing a certain piece of it, it\u2019s like a weight is lifted inside of him. And it\u2019s one of the few times during my week where I feel like my mind isn\u2019t being invaded by everyone else\u2019s. Being at home with my mom, being in studio, and painting with Frank - those are the times I feel like my mind is in harmony with itself. ",
        "Sam: That sounds really nice. ",
        "Chloe: It is. Talking to Mark has been like that for you, hasn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: Um, yeah. Yeah, it has. I hate that he\u2019s trapped there but whenever I do manage to get back, he always greets me with the biggest smile and jumps right back into where we left off in our conversation. And then we just talk for hours. I\u2019m able to tell him things that I haven\u2019t told anyone else. And I don\u2019t mean the really bad stuff - he doesn\u2019t know about my parents or the trenches or how bad the attacks get sometimes - but it\u2019s everything else. All those thoughts and secrets I\u2019ve been keeping to myself for all these years. I can tell him because he understands. And not just because he\u2019s time traveled too. He just understands. ",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s a good feeling, isn\u2019t it? Having someone know you?",
        "Sam: Yeah it is. Telling Mark about me, talking to him, has made me more me in a way? I know that sounds stupid, but I think- I think somewhere amongst all the tragedy, and the panic, and the loneliness, I forgot how to be a person. Or, at least, the person I can be. And now I feel like I\u2019m waking up for the first time in a decade. Does that- do you get that at all?",
        "Chloe: I really, really do actually. Except sometimes I feel like I\u2019m too many people. If I spend a lot of time around someone, their thoughts will sink into my head and kind of take over when I\u2019m not paying attention. Like, I\u2019ll have dreams about Caleb\u2019s boyfriend or nightmares about the war. I\u2019ve even found myself wondering about scientific questions that I don\u2019t even have the necessary knowledge to ask. And it\u2019s easy to lose myself in all the noise. But then I realized, that\u2019s who I am now. This current version of me, this right-now Chloe, is the girl that has a bunch of other peoples\u2019 thoughts in her head. And that\u2019s okay. ",
        "Sam: I like that. That\u2019s a good way of looking at things. ",
        "Chloe: So what version of Sam are you?",
        "Sam: I\u2019m not sure yet. The Sam who\u2019s learned to live with her unique situation? Sam who actually maybe wants to spend time with people? The Sam who\u2019s going to bring someone back to the future? Whatever I am, I think what\u2019s important is that I finally have options. ",
        "Chloe: And that\u2019s terrifying on it\u2019s own. ",
        "Sam: Right. ",
        "Chloe: But it\u2019s not terrifying in the same way as before. ",
        "Sam: You read my mind. ",
        "Chloe: This is pretty heavy coffee conversation. Do you ever stop and wonder when your life got so weird? No, right, of course not, you\u2019ve been dealing with this for practically your whole life. God, I can\u2019t imagine that. ",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know, my life has definitely increased in weirdness in the past few months. I never thought I could tell anybody about my ability, let alone that I would find other people who are like me. It\u2019s, well, it\u2019s really nice actually. This has been really nice. Talking to you. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, it has. Caleb\u2019s great but he\u2019s still basically a kid. It\u2019s nice to talk to another woman around my age about this stuff. Actually, it\u2019s just nice to talk to another woman around my age in general. I haven\u2019t been spending a lot of time with my peers since the voices started up. ",
        "Sam: But you\u2019re still in college right? Is that going okay?",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s starting to. I\u2019ve been easing back in but it\u2019s still hard to be in large groups of other students. And, honestly, even hanging out with my old friends one-on-one is sort of impossible. They don\u2019t know about what I can do but they can tell that something is off. I can hear everything they\u2019re thinking and I just- I feel so guilty about it. ",
        "Sam: That sounds tough. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, but at least I have my mom, and Dr. Bright, and Frank, who\u2019s too focused on getting better to notice that I\u2019m a little weird. And now I know you and Caleb too. There are a lot of people out there struggling with things who have a lot less. I\u2019m lucky. ",
        "Sam: God, I don\u2019t know how you do it. ",
        "Chloe: Optimism isn\u2019t your go-to is it?",
        "Sam: Definitely not. Do you think you\u2019ll ever tell your friends about you?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d understand. I know they love me but I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried they would freak out and leave.",
        "Sam: Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just not take the risk, right?",
        "Chloe: Right. I keep waiting for a moment when I\u2019m going to feel comfortable with the way I am. Like, I\u2019m just going to wake up one day and be completely in control and have everything back to normal. But that\u2019s never going to happen is it?",
        "Sam: No. Dr. Bright and I have spent a lot of time talking about acceptance. She\u2019s told me that, even if I do get my ability totally under control, I might still have the occasional panic attack and leave without meaning to. And that I should try to accept that. Life is going to be stressful. Bad things are going to happen. It\u2019s about how you respond that matters and that\u2019s- that's what I\u2019m trying to figure out. Hey, are you okay?",
        "Chloe: Uh, yeah, sorry, someone over in the corner has started doing their taxes? Or balancing their budget or something? Whatever it is, it\u2019s giving me a headache. I hate math. ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sorry. Should we- should we go?",
        "Chloe: Do you mind?",
        "Sam: No, not at all, let\u2019s-",

        "[sfx: ringing phone]",
        "Sam: (over the phone) Hello?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think I figured it out.",
        "Sam: Dr. Bright? What time is it?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry to call so late, Sam, but I think I know how we\u2019re going to get Mark back.",
        "Sam: What? How? What?",
        "Dr. Bright: You and Mark are in different places.",
        "Sam: Yeah. He\u2019s in the past and I\u2019m in the present.",
        "Dr. Bright: No, you\u2019re in different dimensions. You\u2019re occupying completely different planes of the universe, even when you are both in 1810.",
        "Sam: Huh?",
        "Dr. Bright: When someone time travels they move into a separate plane of existence. Time is happening all at once, all the time, so when you go back in time you are actually just moving laterally into a different dimension. Or, that\u2019s the theory anyway.",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m totally lost.",
        "Dr. Bright: Think of the space you occupy in the world as a bubble. Every person occupies their own personal bubble of time and space. These bubbles - these circles - overlap to form a Venn diagram. That\u2019s the present day. Your circle and my circle are separate and unique - we can\u2019t exist simultaneously in the same exact space in the universe and we\u2019ve both been on earth and will be on earth for a specific set of time, but our circles overlap and their point of connection is the present day. Do you follow?",
        "Sam: Um, I think so?",
        "Dr. Bright: When you\u2019re in the present, you are able to occupy that middle part of the Venn diagram. You can interact with the world around you - you\u2019re solid. But when you\u2019re in the past, you\u2019re stuck in your separate part of the circle. You can\u2019t get to the middle bit, you\u2019re just looking in. And it\u2019s a one way window: you can see out into the past but the past can\u2019t see into your circle.",
        "Sam: But Mark can see me.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s because he\u2019s in the same position but on the opposite side. And it\u2019s as if there\u2019s a window you can see through at the point where your two circles connect. Not where they overlap but the point where the two circles first collide.",
        "Sam: Okay, okay, just, uh, just give me a second.",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam?",
        "Sam: Yeah, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m just drawing a Venn diagram to try and get an idea of what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "Dr. Bright: When you time travel, you\u2019re not leaving your circle to go into other circles of time. I think you\u2019re simply opening a window into the past.",
        "Sam: But I go away. Looking through a window would make sense for mental time travelers but my body leaves.",
        "Dr. Bright: I think you enter some kind of middle dimension. One in which time doesn\u2019t exist. Or, at least, it exists differently. That\u2019s why when you come back so little time has passed.",
        "Sam: Okay, I think I understand what you\u2019re getting at. But I still don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to help Mark.",
        "Dr. Bright: You need to reach through that point of contact - the moment where the lines cross before overlapping - and pull him out.",
        "Sam: Okay, but we\u2019re not actually in circles.",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I\u2019m still speaking metaphorically.",
        "Sam: Okay, so how do I not metaphorically reach across that line- isn\u2019t that- isn\u2019t that reaching into another dimension?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. It is.",
        "Sam: And how the hell am I supposed to do that?",
        "Dr. Bright: You do it all the time.",
        "Sam: I do?",
        "Dr. Bright: The water, Sam. For some reason, water - and bullets apparently- permeate the edges of your dimension. They aren\u2019t contained by their time circle.",
        "Sam: Why?",
        "Dr. Bright: That, I don\u2019t know. Maybe the veil between dimensions is porous, maybe if something moves fast enough it can break through. I\u2019m not sure. I have a feeling there are things about your power we are never going to understand. But I think if you and Mark went into a lake or pond together, you might be able to use the water as a conduit to reach through to his dimension and pull him back.",

        "Sam: Right, um, okay. Are you sure it\u2019ll work?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. But it\u2019s the best theory I\u2019ve got.",

        "Chloe: Really? That\u2019s incredible! How?",
        "Sam: Uhh, I\u2019m still not entirely sure. She called me at midnight last night talking about dimensions and Venn diagrams and water acting as some sort of inter dimensional bridge? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m getting ready to head over there now to talk to her about it.",
        "Chloe: Why do you sound nervous about that? I thought you\u2019d be happy.",
        "Sam: And I thought you couldn\u2019t read my mind through the phone.",
        "Chloe: I've only known you for a month but I can tell when you\u2019re nervous.",
        "Sam: I guess I\u2019m just worried about it actually working. I mean, Mark and I haven\u2019t talked that much about getting him out. Lately, it\u2019s like we both choose to ignore the reality of his situation when I\u2019m there.",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been happy for the distraction.",
        "Sam: Yes, exactly! And, well, I haven\u2019t told him yet that I\u2019m working with Dr. Bright-",
        "Chloe: Wait, why not?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. After I didn\u2019t tell him that first trip it just got harder and harder to bring it up. It started to feel like a lie, you know? And I just- I wanted this one thing for myself - it\u2019s been so wonderful getting to know him and I know I\u2019m going to have to tell him eventually but I don\u2019t want it to be about that. I don\u2019t want him to want to talk to me because I\u2019m the person getting him out. I want him to want to talk to me for me. I know that that\u2019s selfish but-",
        "Chloe: I get it. You don\u2019t want to burst the little bubble you guys are in.",
        "Sam: Yeah. I\u2019ve vaguely mentioned that I\u2019m looking into solutions. But I haven\u2019t wanted to make it seem too real, yet. I\u2019ll tell him once we get it all figured out. Once we feel as confident as we can that it\u2019ll work. I just, I don\u2019t want to make promises to him I can\u2019t keep. I don\u2019t think I could stand to disappoint him.",
        "Chloe: So, I don\u2019t mean to pry or anything, but you talk about Mark a lot and you\u2019re nervous about him coming back and well, I\u2019ve heard some stuff in your thoughts before, sorry, but I have to ask: what exactly is going to happen when he gets back? With the, you know, with the two of you.",
        "Sam: What do you mean?",
        "Chloe: Well, it kind of seems to me that you, you know, think about him in a romantic kind of way. Have you guys talked about that at all?",
        "Sam: What? No- what? That\u2019s- I mean, that\u2019s just- It\u2019s really obvious, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Chloe: Really obvious. And it\u2019s part of what\u2019s making you nervous, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: How are you doing this?",
        "Chloe: I\u2019ve learned how you think, Sam. It\u2019s not hard.",
        "Sam: Yeah, it\u2019s making me nervous. Because no, we haven\u2019t talked about it and we met under the most messed up circumstances possible and I don\u2019t know how to do this-",
        "Chloe: Whoa slow down-",
        "Sam: But it\u2019s just- I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never felt this way about anyone before! And it\u2019s not the time travel thing or the fact that he literally has no one else to talk to - though that is definitely cause for concern - it\u2019s. I\u2019ve never met anyone like him before. And I know I\u2019ve barely met any people at all, but even in my most indulgent daydreams I never thought- I never thought it would be like this. I never understood it - what everyone was always losing their heads over. But he\u2019s- he\u2019s so kind and funny and smart and spontaneous and he makes me feel like maybe I\u2019m not this weird, out of place person. Like, being with him, it\u2019s like being home.",
        "Chloe: And him? How does he feel?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. Like I said, we\u2019ve never talked about it. But sometimes- yeah, sometimes I think that maybe he feels the same way. The way he says my name and the way he smiles at me sometimes and we do talk about the future a bit. Like what we would do if he could get back to the present.",
        "Chloe: We?",
        "Sam: Yeah. We talk about going on a road trip, you know, across the country. He misses his camera so much - and he wants to photograph every state. He\u2019s already traveled quite a lot, but he\u2019s never done a big road trip. And I\u2019ve never been anywhere. Well, okay, I mean, I\u2019ve been lots of places, but I\u2019ve never seen modern-day New York or California with people. And I haven\u2019t been in a car for a long period of time in 10 years. Mark wants to teach me to drive.",
        "Chloe: That sounds really nice, Sam.",
        "Sam: Yeah, it does. It does, right?",
        "Chloe:  What are you so worried about?",
        "Sam: I\u2019ve never done this before! Any of this! I don\u2019t know how to- you know, it\u2019s been sort of a relief, not being able to touch. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to- it\u2019s, ugh, this is so embarrassing.",
        "Chloe: What is?       ",
        "Sam: What do I do when I see him for real? Like his actual physical person in the present day. Do I give him a hug? Do I shake his hand?",
        "Chloe: Well, what do you want to do?",
        "Sam: I think- I think it might be nice to hug him. Or kiss him or- I don\u2019t know how to do any of this.",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m sure kissing hasn\u2019t changed since the last time you did it. Sam? Are you still there?",
        "Sam: Mm-hm. Um, I\u2019ve- I\u2019ve never actually kissed anyone before. I know that that\u2019s strange for a 25 year old - like, there must be something wrong with her, right?",
        "Chloe: There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, Sam. You don\u2019t ever have to kiss anyone at all ever as far as I\u2019m concerned. If you don\u2019t want to. But you want to?",
        "Sam: I think so. God, this is such a stupid thing to be fixating on! I\u2019m about to go talk to a brilliant scientist about inter-dimensional travel and I\u2019m hung up on my first kiss.",
        "Chloe: I think that\u2019s okay. You deserve a bit of fun, I think.",
        "Sam: Yeah. It\u2019s like my brain finally has room for other things now that it\u2019s not full of anxiety 24/7. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve totally talked your ear off and now I\u2019ve got to run and grab the bus.",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s fine. I have an idea - now that I\u2019m 21 and everything, I\u2019m gonna go buy a bottle of wine and I\u2019ll come over after you\u2019re done with Dr. Bright. We\u2019ll forget all about dimension jumping and mind reading and have an honest-to-god girl\u2019s night. You can moon over Mark and I\u2019ll make you feel better by telling you all about my ridiculous exes.                           ",

        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s been over a month since you\u2019ve been in - I was growing concerned.",
        "Damien: No you weren\u2019t. You\u2019ve been too busy selling me out to The AM.",

        "Damien: After that whole big speech about how evil they were, about how you would never hand me over, I get a call from Agent Green, who seemed to know quite a bit about me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Have they come after you?",
        "Damien: No. He\u2019s sort of benign, isn\u2019t he? He mostly just wants to talk on the phone. I\u2019ve screened most of his calls.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad to hear that.",
        "Damien: It was still a pretty bitchy thing to do, Dr. B.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. I\u2019m- I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m apologizing. Both for that and the way I spoke to you last time we saw each other. I may have my own complicated feelings about you but the things I said were out of line.",
        "Damien: Wow. That was almost heartfelt. What do you want?",
        "Dr. Bright: I need your help.",
        "Damien: This is about Mark, I\u2019m assuming?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. I want to break him out of The AM and I want you to help me do it.",
        "Damien: My, my, Dr. B., that is quite an ask.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know.",
        "Damien: Why the hell would I say yes? Now that The AM know about me, you have nothing to hold over my head. And last I checked, you weren\u2019t the one who could make people do whatever you want.",
        "Dr. Bright: I am willing to return the favor.",
        "Damien: How?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you want?",
        "Damien: Really? I get to choose? God, you really must be desperate.",
        "Dr. Bright: You are my only option at this point, Damien. I am no longer welcome on the premises of The AM facility. I would be detained immediately upon arrival.",
        "Damien: Ah, is that why Agent Green schlepped over to your office for your meeting?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Besides, you should have no trouble getting past the guards. Just will them to ignore you.",
        "Damien: Well, now, according to everything you\u2019ve told me, I have to really want to get in. I need to want to jailbreak Mark in order for my ability to work. So once again I ask, what are you offering?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you want? Full access to my research? Sessions every day? Name your price, Damien. I\u2019m sure we can work something out.",
        "Damien: I want you to find someone like me.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Damien: C\u2019mon, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m the only person who can do what I do. I want you to use your resources and your, uh, special relationship with Agent Green to find other people like me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Fine. But it might take a while - I\u2019m not currently familiar with anyone else of your talents. I need you to follow through on your end of the bargain first.",
        "Damien:  Are we on a schedule?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Two weeks from today would be the ideal time. Saturdays are always pretty quiet at The AM and it will be doubly so because of the holiday weekend. If you go in after hours there should be minimal security. I have floor plans of the whole facility - I\u2019ll show you the fastest route in and out. The whole thing shouldn\u2019t take more than a half hour.",
        "Damien: Why would you trust me with this?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because, Damien, you were right. As reluctant as I am to admit it, you are my closest friend. I don\u2019t have any other options.",
        "Damien: You know this isn\u2019t going to stop at one return favor right? You\u2019ll owe me for a long time.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. But I\u2019m the closest I\u2019ve ever been to getting my brother back and I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes. And I know you understand that if you do anything to compromise his safety or screw us over I will help The AM track you down and lock you up for the rest of your days.",

        "Caleb: Oh, I didn\u2019t know you had family in the area.",
        "Adam: Yeah, we don\u2019t see her very often. She\u2019s my mom\u2019s sister. She has some 90-hour-a-week, high-powered office job - like a hedge fund or something - so we have lunch like, three times a year. It\u2019s always this weird competition between her and my mom about who\u2019s more successful. It\u2019s exhausting.",
        "Caleb: So, wait, do you have, like, cousins?",
        "Adam: Not from Annabelle. I have a few on my dad\u2019s side, but they live far away.",

        "Adam: Yeah, sure, maybe.",

I\u2019ve been - okay, so I've been going to art therapy with Chloe every now and then. Sometimes we go just the two of us - she said it really helps clear her mind and kind of calm down, and it\u2019s actually been doing the same for me. There\u2019s always a group of people there, but with everyone focused on their art, the emotions are, like, easier to handle. Well, like, most of the time anyway. I mean, sometimes someone is putting all their anger or stress or whatever into their art and that\u2019s tough but - do you remember that homeless guy I told you about?

I want to help Chloe help him, but I\u2019ve stopped going when she\u2019s there with him. It- I get these terrible headaches and feel, like, all dizzy and nauseous after like, 15 minutes of being around him.",

        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. And this is, like, so much worse. It\u2019s like - you know when you put- okay, you know when you put a microphone near a speaker and there\u2019s this horrible feedback screech-y sound?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I think I\u2019m familiar.",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s like, totally like that.",
        "Dr. Bright: Hm. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like that happening in an empath before. But I don\u2019t follow - what does this have to do with Chloe and Adam?",
        "Caleb: Right. So Chloe ran into Adam and his parents and they were, you know, making nice small talk and stuff I guess, and Chloe was mentioning how she was going to go paint with Frank. And I guess Adam\u2019s parents were asking about that and Chloe mentioned that Frank was an ex-marine who had all these emotional problems and that\u2019s when- that\u2019s when she saw some stuff in Mr. and Mrs. Hayes\u2019 heads. Or, Dr. and Dr. Hayes I guess. What do you call a couple who are both doctors?",
        "Dr. Bright: The Drs. Hayes, I suppose. What did Chloe see?",
        "Caleb: She wasn\u2019t totally sure, but I guess mentioning the Marines made the Hayes think about their work - I guess they work with the military? I didn\u2019t know that. I just always assumed they worked at a hospital.",
        "Dr. Bright: It isn\u2019t unusual for the military to hire scientists.",
        "Caleb: No, I know that, but Adam\u2019s never mentioned it. I feel like that\u2019s a pretty big thing to leave out. Especially since Adam has a lot of opinions about the military.",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that what\u2019s causing you concern? That Adam\u2019s parents work in an area he doesn\u2019t approve of?",
        "Caleb: No it\u2019s - it\u2019s the kind of work they\u2019re doing. Chloe, she only got glimpses so she can\u2019t be sure, but she said she saw a lot of not good stuff. They were thinking about Marines they\u2019d worked with- or no, they worked on. They were experimenting with them- on them- ugh, I don\u2019t know. But she saw Frank. In the Hayes\u2019 head. They were doing something to him. She said it was a different Frank too - like, younger, healthier. And the Hayes\u2019 and some other scientists were doing something to him and a bunch of other soldiers but the soldiers knew about it. So, I don\u2019t fucking know what that means.",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe got all this from their thoughts by mentioning Frank?",
        "Caleb: Well, no. After she saw the first bit of something, she started talking about Frank more and asking some questions. She\u2019s gotten really good at making people think of certain things.",
        "Dr. Bright: I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it\u2019s actually - it's pretty cool. And apparently when she started talking about other organizations that she\u2019s looked into to help Frank - like the art therapy place and the VA and the vet center and all that - that\u2019s when she saw this symbol in the Hayes\u2019 thoughts. Apparently it\u2019s like, the same logo or whatever that she saw in that Agent\u2019s head - the- the PM or whatever?",
        "Dr. Bright: The AM? Chloe saw The AM\u2019s logo in the Hayes\u2019 thoughts?",
        "Caleb: I guess.                          Dr. Bright: Is she certain?",
        "Caleb: She seemed pretty certain.",
        "Dr. Bright: She should have called me.",
        "Caleb: It just happened this morning. And she called me right away to tell me.",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand that impulse. If your boyfriend\u2019s parents work for The AM then-",
        "Caleb: No, no they don\u2019t work for them. They just- they work with them.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Caleb: Chloe was pretty sure about that. They don\u2019t work for The AM or whatever it\u2019s called but they\u2019ve been working with them on the soldier experiments that they\u2019re doing. And Chloe is worried it might have something to do with us.",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Caleb: Well, she said that she saw the organization logo thing and then a bunch of stuff about Class A. And she says that\u2019s what we are. In the categorization of atypicals or something, that's I'm a Class A, we're Class As.",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Yes that\u2019s true. So Adam\u2019s parents are working with the military and The AM to experiment with Class A atypicals who are also soldiers? I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s a bit of a hard story to swallow. I don\u2019t think there are enough known Class A atypicals to populate the military.",
        "Caleb: No, the soldiers aren\u2019t special like us. Chloe thinks they were using atypicals to experiment on the Marines. She thinks they did something to Frank.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s a pretty serious accusation.",
        "Caleb: I know. But, look, I trust her. She knows that she can\u2019t be one hundred percent sure without talking to them more, but Chloe thinks that\u2019s why I have such a strong reaction to Frank. Because they, like, did something with his empathy.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s what she saw in the Hayes\u2019 thoughts? That they were experimenting on Frank\u2019s empathy?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, I\u2019ll have to follow up with Chloe myself but this is certainly cause for concern.",
        "Caleb: I know. And I don\u2019t know what to do.",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you talked to Adam?",
        "Caleb: I texted him earlier. But he and his parents were on their way to have lunch with his aunt and apparently that\u2019s usually a pretty drawn-out thing so I don\u2019t- I don't think he\u2019s checking his phone.",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you text him?",
        "Caleb: Just that I\u2019m really freaked out. That I\u2019m worried his parents are dangerous. I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t feel like this before, it- But now that I know Chloe and I know there are other people out there like me, it feels like a them-and-us situation, you know? Like, what if his parents are against people like me?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t want you to grow paranoid Caleb. I know that Chloe has learned a lot about The AM in these past few weeks - and I\u2019m very much responsible for that - but I don\u2019t want her filling your head with fears.",
        "Caleb: No, no, she\u2019s not. But I\u2019m still, like, totally freaked out. If Adam\u2019s parents see people like me as something to be experimented on, then how can I know he won\u2019t eventually feel the exact same way?",
        "Dr. Bright: Have Adam\u2019s parents ever treated you differently?",
        "Caleb: No, not really. But I mean, I\u2019ve barely met them - they\u2019re hardly ever around. And I don\u2019t think Adam has told them much about me.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s good. I don\u2019t want you to fret too much Caleb, but it might be good to keep the Hayes ignorant of your ability. At least until we found out more.",
        "Caleb: Are you- are you gonna look into it?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ll make some inquiries. Your safety is very important to me.",
        "Caleb: Okay, thanks Dr. Bright. I just hope it\u2019s important to Adam too.",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand your worry, Caleb, I do. But from everything you\u2019ve told me, Adam cares for you very much. I don\u2019t think he would let his parents\u2019 work affect your relationship.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. But-",
        "[sfx: text tone]",
        "Caleb: Oh god, that\u2019s him. He says he has no idea what I\u2019m talking about. And he\u2019s wondering where I am.",
        "[sfx: text sending]",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you tell him?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, maybe we can talk after this or something.",
        "Dr. Bright: I think that would be a good idea. How have things been going with you two in general?",
        "Caleb: They\u2019ve been good. Well, actually, they\u2019ve been okay. The past- the past few weeks have been tough.",
        "Dr. Bright: How so?",
        "Caleb: Well, ever since we ran into Damien, things have been a little, like strained. Like, when we first started hanging out outside your office, it was just for fun. He thought the whole atypical thing was kind of cool and we had, like, a really good time coming up with crazy theories. But, I don\u2019t know, meeting Damien - and Chloe even - it just, it made it a lot more real. Like, this is my life. I\u2019m part of this group of people that are so different from everybody else. For years I\u2019ve felt like a total freak and now, well, Adam made it better. He makes it better. But there\u2019s this whole other world out there that I\u2019m just learning about.",
        "Dr. Bright: And that\u2019s causing tension between you two?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Because he can\u2019t really understand. And there\u2019s stuff I really don\u2019t understand about him. Like how sad he gets sometimes - even though I feel it too, I just - I don\u2019t fucking get it.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know he was sad before you two started spending time together,  but I thought it had improved somewhat?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it definitely did at first. But it comes and goes. He just gets really- he has depression. And we haven\u2019t talked about it much, but I can tell when he\u2019s having a bad time. Obviously. And he hates that I can tell and there\u2019s nothing I can do to make it better so we\u2019re just, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not as easy as it was at first.",
        "Dr. Bright: How long have you two been dating?",
        "Caleb: Almost three months.",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah, yes. That sounds about right.",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: The honeymoon period is over. When you first start a relationship with someone, everything is new and exciting. It\u2019s easy to ignore the things that might complicate the relationship. Now that you two are settled into it a bit, life is starting to come back into play. Neither your nor Adam\u2019s personal challenges disappear just because you\u2019re together.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess. It just sort of felt like that at first though.",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. Just remember to communicate. You may never be able to understand his depression and he may never understand what it\u2019s like to have an ability like yours, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be there for each other.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, no, you\u2019re right. And you were right before too - he cares about me. He would never ever tell my secret to anyone. God, just everything Chloe saw had me so fucking scared. I got it in my head that everyone was plotting against me, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m familiar with the feeling. Was that the door?",
        "Adam: (through the door) Hello? Caleb?",
        "[sfx: opening door]",
        "Dr. Bright: You must be Adam. I\u2019m Dr. Bright. Caleb is in here.",
        "Caleb: Adam, what are you doing here?",
        "Adam: I walked over here from my aunt\u2019s house. What the hell happened with Chloe today? She was acting sort of strange when we saw her earlier but I just kind of assumed it was Chloe being Chloe.",
        "Caleb: She saw all this stuff in your parents\u2019 thoughts-",
        " Adam: Yeah, that they work for the military? That\u2019s ridiculous.",
        "Caleb: Well, where do they work?",
        "Adam: They work at a hospital. Because they\u2019re doctors.",
        "Caleb: What hospital?",
        "Adam: The- the one over on First. I don\u2019t know, does it matter?",
        "Caleb: How do you not know where your parents work?",
        "Adam: They don\u2019t talk about it - a lot of the research they do is confidential.",
        "Caleb: See what I mean? Who knows what shady shit they\u2019re up to?",
        "Adam: Hey, those are my parents!",
        "Dr. Bright: Gentlemen, let\u2019s try to remain civil please.",
        "Caleb: Sorry, Dr. Bright. I sort of forgot you were there.",
        "Adam: Yeah, sorry.",
        "Caleb: Actually, could you just give us a minute?",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. I have some files that need sorting anyway.",
        "[sfx: door closing]",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m sorry. The texting earlier - I overreacted. Chloe saw a bunch of stuff but we don\u2019t know anything for sure. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve told your parents about me, so even if they were experimenting on people- what? Wait, Adam, why do you feel scared?",
        "Adam: I- I did tell them about you.",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Adam: Well, after I first found out, I wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t going completely crazy so I asked my mom if it was neurologically possible. And she talked about all this theoretical stuff that mostly went over my head but it made me realize that you weren\u2019t messing with me.",
        "Caleb: But you never asked her about it again, right? So there\u2019s no reason for her to think it has anything to do with me?Adam.",
        "Adam: You haven\u2019t given me a lot to go on, okay, Caleb? You don\u2019t tell me how I can make things easier for you so I had to do some independent research. I was trying to be a good boyfriend.",
        "Caleb: By going behind my back and telling your mom my biggest secret? I mean, how could you do that?",
        "Adam: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think it would be that big of a deal. It\u2019s just my mom! It\u2019s not like I told the whole world.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but it\u2019s your mom who might just be, like, an evil scientist who totally fucked with Frank\u2019s head!",
        "Adam: What the hell are you talking about? Caleb, my parents aren\u2019t dangerous, they would never hurt you-",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t believe you! I can feel you panicking and I can feel Dr. Bright worried sick and I just - I can\u2019t do this right now, okay?",
        "Adam: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s too much! I\u2019m barely dealing with my own feelings and then everything that\u2019s been going on with you, I just- Ican\u2019t have all this stuff hanging over my head and fucking me up. What if I totally crack - what if your parents or The AM or Damien do something to me and I end up like Frank, my emotions totally out of control-",
        "Adam: Caleb, nothing\u2019s going to happen to you-",
        "Caleb: No, don\u2019t - I just, I need to go be alone for a while, alright?",
        "Adam: Okay, I\u2019ll walk you home-",
        "Caleb: No, I need to be alone, alone. Just- just let me be for a little while okay? And- and don\u2019t tell your parents about me.",
        "Adam: Caleb, you\u2019re acting like I betrayed you. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, I lo- I- you mean a lot to me. I don\u2019t want you to shut out-",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m sorry-",
        "[sfx: opening door]",
        "Adam: Caleb-",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, is everything all right?",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m just gonna go home. Thanks for seeing me so last minute, Dr. Bright.",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s no problem. Are you going to be okay getting home?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, my mom\u2019s been waiting outside the whole time. She was worried.",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for your regular session.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, sure.",
        "Adam: Caleb, please, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Can you please just talk to me?",

        "Caleb: I- I\u2019ll see you in school.",
        "[sfx: closing door]",
        "Dr. Bright: Would you like to sit down, Adam? You look a little faint.",
        "Adam: Yeah. Yeah, that would be good. What just happened?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t hear what the two of you were discussing.",
        "Adam: I think he maybe just broke up with me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb has had a stressful day. Just give him some space and I\u2019m sure you two will be able to sort things out. Would you like to me call someone to come pick you up?",
        "Adam: What? Oh, um, no, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll text my parents. They should be on their way back from my aunt\u2019s anyway.",
        "[sfx: text sending]",
        "Adam: What did he tell you? What did Chloe see?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t tell you what Caleb said in our session.",
        "Adam: Right, of course, sorry. The whole therapist code and everything. My parents keep trying to get me to see a therapist.",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t want to?",
        "Adam: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I know you\u2019ve helped Caleb a lot. But that\u2019s Caleb. He doesn\u2019t have emotional problems, he just feels the emotional problems of others. It\u2019s different.",
        "Dr. Bright: Just because someone is an atypical doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have their own burdens to bear. Talking to someone can be helpful no matter what you\u2019re going through.",
        "Adam: I guess. But whenever my parents bring it up, they talk about all this stuff - CBT and group therapy and medication and it\u2019s all a bit...",
        "Dr. Bright: Scary?",
        "Adam: What? No, I\u2019m not scared. I just don\u2019t think I need all that stuff.",
        "Dr. Bright: Going to therapy or using medication doesn\u2019t make you a weak person, Adam.",
        "Adam: Yeah, but Caleb doesn\u2019t do group or take meds or any of that stuff. I know he and his mom asked when he first started seeing you. But not like the golden boy needs meds or anything.",
        "Dr. Bright: My patients are unique. Sometimes frustratingly so. While medication isn\u2019t always the solution, it can be very helpful for certain individuals. But science hasn\u2019t quite caught up to atypicals. I\u2019ve met many atypicals who would benefit from pharmaceuticals, but they just don\u2019t work. We don\u2019t have a good enough understanding of the neurology yet. But regardless of what Caleb\u2019s options or modes of coping are, you and he are not the same person. You can\u2019t compare your situation with another\u2019s - your difficulties are different and so your ways of dealing with them will be different too. But not dealing with them at all will get you nowhere.",
        "Adam: So you think I should listen to my parents?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think you shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to seek help. I can\u2019t offer any official advice - I\u2019m not your therapist nor could I be. I am very specialized, after all. But I can give you some names, if you\u2019d like.",
        "Adam: Yeah, okay. Do you think Caleb will stay my boyfriend if I stop being depressed?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think Caleb cares about you as the complete person you are. But he\u2019s not a superhero. He won\u2019t always be able to make you feel better. And that\u2019s okay. Atypical or no, you\u2019re both human. You\u2019re going to make mistakes; just go easy on each other.",

        "Dr. Bright: Alright, let\u2019s go over the plan one more time.",
        "Sam: The recorder\u2019s on?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes.",
        "Sam: Good.",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you nervous?",
        "Sam: Nervous? Um, am I nervous? Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m nervous. I'm really, really nervous.",
        "Dr. Bright: Everything is going to be fine. You\u2019ve gotten the jump down perfectly. It will be just like all those other times you\u2019ve gone to see Mark.",
        "Sam: Right. Seven out of nine. That\u2019s how many times I\u2019ve gone back on purpose. That\u2019s pretty good, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s excellent. Okay, we still have about an hour until Damien is supposed to call-",
        "Sam: Are you sure about him?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, it\u2019s a little late to call him off now.",
        "Sam: True, but- I don\u2019t know, aren\u2019t you worried he\u2019s going to mess everything up?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why would he? Damien doesn\u2019t cause trouble for the sake of trouble. At least not since I\u2019ve known him. He behaves badly in order to make whatever selfish gains he needs to or because he thinks it\u2019s what expected of him. Which it is, I suppose, but it\u2019s a bit of a chicken and egg situation.",
        "Sam: Right. So he\u2019s not going to - I don\u2019t know, go in there and kill a bunch of guards for the fun of it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Lord, no. He knows that deviating the plan could land him in the cell right next to Mark.",
        "Sam: Speaking of the plan-",
        "Dr. Bright: Right. Damien is going to enter here - there\u2019s only one guard at this gate and then another at the entrance. He\u2019ll have to persuade a guard to give him their key card and then from there he\u2019ll take the East stairway down to the sub-basement. Then it\u2019s just a matter of walking into the secure area and opening Mark\u2019s cell.",
        "Sam: Oh, sure. Easy-peasy.",
        "Dr. Bright: The highest security levels are manned by guards, not protected by keypads or locks. Which actually works better for us - Damien won\u2019t need any codes to get through.",
        "Sam: That- that really doesn\u2019t sound like very much security for something like The AM.",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s easier to protect something when no one knows it exists.",
        "Sam: I guess.",
        "Dr. Bright: What were you expecting?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know - lasers? A moat? Mutant dogs? You\u2019ve made The AM sound pretty super-villain-y",
        "Dr. Bright: Sorry to disillusion you, but it\u2019s a pretty basic government building.",
        "Sam: And you\u2019re sure The AM hasn\u2019t updated their security system in two years? That seems unlikely.",
        "Dr. Bright: Bureaucracy moves very slowly, Sam. They\u2019d just installed a brand new system before I left - there\u2019s no way they\u2019ve gotten around to another update.",
        "Sam: Wait, won\u2019t Damien\u2019s power wear off the guards eventually? They\u2019ll come looking for him right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Not if he\u2019s in and out in fifteen minutes. We\u2019ve been practicing and his control is getting better.",
        "Sam: You\u2019ve been helping him improve his ability?",
        "Dr. Bright: Only as much as we need.",
        "Sam: Jesus, Dr. Bright. Okay, so we have fifteen minutes to make this work.",
        "Dr. Bright: Right. Which is why the moment Damien enters the sub-basement, you make the jump. You can spend as much time as you want in 1810 to prepare to pull Mark back but, once you do, you need to come to the same time you left. Or as close as you can get. We can\u2019t have Damien waiting around for Mark to wake up. I doubt Damien would be able to carry him and I don\u2019t like the idea of him having custody over an unconscious Mark.",
        "Sam: Okay, okay. And then- then they come here.",
        "Dr. Bright: Exactly. Mark will be in bad shape I imagine - bed sores are going to be the least of our troubles. He\u2019ll recuperate here.",
        "Sam: You really think a tiny motel room is the best place for him to recover?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s discrete and in the opposite direction from the city. They won\u2019t look for us here.",
        "Sam: But they will look for us, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. But they won\u2019t be able to prove either of our involvement. And you and Mark will be off on your road trip soon enough so it will blow over. They have bigger fish to fry and they know they messed up with this one. I think they\u2019ll eventually let it go.",
        "Sam: That\u2019s optimistic. I still don\u2019t like the idea of leaving you here for months.",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s fine, Sam. I need to look after my other patients and you need to go see the world. Or at least the country. And spend the mountains of money you apparently have.",
        "Sam: It\u2019s amazing the money you can accrue when you don\u2019t spend any for ten years. Well, and get an inheritance. That- that helps too.",
        "Dr. Bright: Mark\u2019s landed himself an heiress, after all. He\u2019ll be thrilled.",
        "Sam: Oh, we\u2019re not- I mean. Nothing\u2019s happened-",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. But I\u2019m a psychologist, remember? I\u2019m good at reading emotions.",
        "Sam: Right. This is sort of awkward. I feel like I should apologize.",
        "Dr. Bright: What for? If Mark feels the same way, then I\u2019m happy for you both.",
        "Sam: Like I said, nothing\u2019s happened. I guess we\u2019ll see.",
        "Dr. Bright: He\u2019s probably waiting to make sure it\u2019s okay to make a move on his sister\u2019s patient first. Not that that\u2019s all you are, of course. Sam? You still haven\u2019t told him, have you?",
        "Sam: I\u2019m going to tell him before we jump, I promise: that you\u2019ve been the one behind all of this, that you\u2019re the one who deserves the credit. I was going to before, really. I ws finally own up to it, even though I know he might be mad that I wasn\u2019t honest. And I started to tell him that I had a way to get him out - a plan - and he- he tried to give me a hug. And it didn\u2019t work, at all, but the gesture was so nice and caught me so off guard that I kind of just wanted to be his knight in shining armor for a little longer.",
        "Dr. Bright: And he\u2019s never mentioned me?",
        "Sam: He has, but- they\u2019re mostly stories about you guys as kids. He hasn\u2019t really mentioned you as an adult yet.",
        "Dr. Bright: I see.",
        "Sam: He really doesn\u2019t like talking about the couple of years before he went away. I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Bright.",
        "Dr. Bright: You know, Sam, if you\u2019re going to be dating my brother, you should probably call me Joan.",
        "Sam: Yeah, okay. Joan. Okay, I guess I should start setting up the feed - make sure everything's running okay. You gave Damien the earpiece?",
        "[sfx: typing]",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. He was very impressed by my \u201cspy tech\u201d as he called it. Don\u2019t worry, he doesn\u2019t know I have a computer genius on my team - he thinks I\u2019m doing this entirely on my own.",
        "Sam: I wouldn't exactly call myself a \u201ccomputer genius\u201d. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time on them, that\u2019s all.",
        "Dr. Bright: As always, I think you\u2019re being too modest, Sam. You seem to really know what you\u2019re talking about.",
        "Sam: Yeah, well a degree in informational sciences and a decade with a computer and a cat as sole companions will force anyone to pick up a few skills. Uh, and the tracker?",
        "Dr. Bright: On the van I purchased. He doesn\u2019t know.",
        "Sam: Good. It\u2019s a transmitter too, just in case he takes out the ear piece. Wait, you bought a van?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s amazing what you can find on craigslist. I figured it was better to have a getaway car that wasn\u2019t registered to anyone. Don\u2019t worry, you and Mark can take a different car cross-country. I\u2019m picturing a red convertible - Mark has never been a subtle person.",
        "Sam: Oh my god, this is completely crazy. Right? I mean -spy tech? Getaway cars? We\u2019re not the CIA, what are we doing?",
        "Dr. Bright: Speak for yourself, Sam. I worked for a secret government organization for years and then tried to breach their high security area.",
        "Sam: Okay, good point. I guess I\u2019m the only fish out of water here then.",
        "Dr. Bright: Not to be blunt, but do you ever feel like a fish in water?",
        "Sam: Uh, no. Also a solid point. At least this is sort of fun.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m beginning to think you don\u2019t know what that word means.",
        "Sam: You might be right. At the very least, my brain feels like it\u2019s being fully used for the first time in a long time.",
        "Dr. Bright: A good mind is a terrible thing to waste, Sam.",
        "Sam: Okay, enough with the platitudes, you\u2019re making me more nervous. Okay, the feed is set up. We just have to wait for him to turn it on.",
        "Dr. Bright: Then we wait.",
        "[sfx: computer ringing]",
        "Sam: That must be him. You want to do all the talking, I assume?",
        "Dr. Bright: Definitely. Damien knows nothing about you and I\u2019d prefer to keep it that way.",
        "Sam: Right. Uh, okay, just press this button here and he\u2019ll be able to hear us. It works like a one way walkie talkie - he can only hear you when you choose, but we can always hear him.",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Damien, right on time.",
        "Damien: (through the computer) Hey, Dr. B. How\u2019s your night going so far?",
        "Dr. Bright: No time for small talk, Damien. Are you at the facility?",
        "Damien: Pulling up to the gate now. Looks like there\u2019s one guard at the gatehouse.",
        "Dr. Bright: As expected. Are you ready for this?",
        "Damien: Why not. Good evening, sir.",
        "Guard: Name and ID number, please?",

        "Guard: Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll let you through.",
        "Damien: Much obliged.",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, it worked. He just has four more security points to get through and then we\u2019ll be fine.",
        "Sam: Oh god. Four more?",
        "Dr. Bright: Two guards at the entrance, then he\u2019ll use a key card to open the locked stairway and the entrance to the sub-basement and one more guard at the entrance into Tier 5.",

        "Dr. Bright: He\u2019s got one more guard post to go through and then he\u2019s in Mark\u2019s room.",

        "Dr. Bright: Sam, you\u2019re going to be fine.",
        "Sam: Yeah, but just- I\u2019ve never tried to pull anything like this before. There are a lot of variables. So if something goes wrong, will you take care of Darwin for me?",

        "Dr. Bright: Damien, tell him to go back to office and keep moving.",
        "Damien: Great. You see, Dr. B. hasn\u2019t exactly been forthcoming with information, which is sort of rude considering how big of a favor I\u2019m doing her.",
        "Agent Green: Favor?",
        "Damien: Don\u2019t worry about it. But you\u2019re familiar with Dr. B.\u2019s brother? Mark?",

        "Agent Green: He\u2019s a mimic. A chameleon of sorts - he shares the power of anyone he\u2019s standing next to.",
        "Damien: Oh my god. So you\u2019re saying if he was in the same room as me, he could do what I do?",
        "Agent Green: Yes.",
        "Damien: Huh, Dr. B certainly failed to mention that. You\u2019re sure it would work?",
        "Agent Green: Well, we\u2019ve never heard of anyone with your ability so I can\u2019t be positive, but Mark\u2019s power doesn\u2019t seem to have any limitations.",

        "Damien: Not that- though I think it could be argued that\u2019s a lie of omission at the very least. No, I meant that you told me finding someone like me could take a long time - that you didn\u2019t know anyone. And all this time, your brother was like me.",
        "Dr. Bright: Mark is nothing like you. We need to have this discussion later. We\u2019re on the clock.",

And then I jumped back. But I think I had a hold on him. I really do. I- I could feel his hand.",

In this episode, you heard Julia Morizawa as Dr. Bright, me as Sam, Charlie Ian as Damien, Ian McQuown as Agent Green, and, for the first time, Andrew Nowak as Mark. You also heard Brad Wilcox and Reyn Beeler as our guards. I also want to thank Briggon Snow, who voices Caleb, Anna Lore, who voices Chloe and does our incredibly beautiful graphic design, and Alex Gallner who voices Adam. And a special thanks goes to Elizabeth Laird, who not only voiced Sarah, but also provided indispensable psychological advice.",

        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t been in this facility for two years until today. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: Right. Of course. So it\u2019s pure coincidence that the perpetrator is a patient of yours and the only subject to escape was your brother. ",

        "Director Wadsworth: I don\u2019t know where you got these ideas about what we do here. You worked here for seven years - did you ever feel like you were torturing people?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not so sure anymore. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: We help people. And yes, things took a turn with Mark - we weren\u2019t prepared for how powerful he was and we certainly didn\u2019t expect Camille to die. We messed up. But so did you, Joan. Taking him out of here without any medical assistance, putting him the hands of a known criminal-?",

        "Dr. Bright: No. No, it\u2019s- when he wants something, really wants something, and he starts to project it, you want it too. It isn\u2019t having your mind overruled as much as it is-",

        "Dr. Bright: I think Damien likes me as much as he can like anyone. Our relationship is complicated. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Wait, you don\u2019t know where they are?",
        "Director Wadsworth: We don\u2019t actually have eyes and ears everywhere, Joan. This isn\u2019t a Bond movie - no one has trackers implanted in their arms and there\u2019s no facial recognition technology scanning all CCTV cameras. They slipped away, at night, on July 4th weekend, when there were very few personnel here to deal with it. The timing was impeccable and now they are, as they say, \u201cin the wind\u201d. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Unbelievable. So-",
        "Director Wadsworth: Your plan would have worked? Yes, I do think it would have if things hadn\u2019t gone so extremely pear-shaped. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here- why you came today with so little objection. You don\u2019t care about the consequences of what you\u2019ve done - you just wanted to know if we had information you didn\u2019t. ",

        "Director Wadsworth: So then, are you willing to cooperate?",
        "Dr. Bright: I thought I was cooperating. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: I mean, from here on out. We may not know where Mark is, but presumably he\u2019s alive and relatively safe. He\u2019ll come back for his big sister eventually, I know he will. It would be a shame for him to return only to find that you\u2019re in prison. ",

        "Director Wadsworth: And I am happy to say we kept that promise, Joan. I have given you so much leeway but the way you conducted yourself at your last quarterly was highly suspicious. Lying to Agent Green about the patients in your office, misidentifying Robert\u2019s power- how did you think we were going to react once we found out?",
        "Dr. Bright: So you snuck into my office and planted bugs?",

You\u2019ve manipulated patients, used them for your own gain- oh, and don\u2019t look so scandalized, you never would have gotten Mark awake without a time traveler so I know you have one of those hidden away. And there\u2019s no way it was mere coincidence that Vanessa\u2019s daughter was in your waiting room when you met with Green. I\u2019m not stupid, Joan. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: You\u2019ve lied to us about the real abilities of at least two of your patients. That is very troublesome. These are people that could benefit from our vast resources, and you\u2019ve robbed them of that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can help them far better than you can. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: Are you sure about that, Joan? Like I said, we\u2019ve made a lot of strides since you left. Are you really so selfish as to deny your patients help that could change their lives? You know, we\u2019re very close to being able to medicate some atypical abilities. Camille\u2019s death was unfortunate but, as you know, every death is a new opportunity to collect data.",

I\u2019m going to be honest with you, Joan. What happened with Mark and Camille was the first in a long line of major fuck-ups. Which, let me tell you, is not how I wanted to start my tenure as Senior Director. You never congratulated me by the way. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Congratulations. ",
        "Director Wadsworth: You left at just the wrong time. You would have been next up for a promotion, I would have made sure of it.  Anyway, what was I saying. Oh yes: I\u2019m not going to report you. I really don\u2019t need to give the higher ups more reason for disappointment. So I\u2019ll handle you myself.

        "Dr. Bright: How was your vacation- you and your family went to your lake house, correct?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, it was good. It was nice, just being with my family for a month. Sometimes they get on my nerves but, all in all, they\u2019re...you know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You have an easier time balancing their feelings. ",
        "Caleb: Right. Yeah, exactly. I mean, Alice is 13 now so like, she\u2019s a real pain in the ass but- sorry - but you know, she\u2019s like, all hormonal and stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Hormonal and stuff?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, like she\u2019s really happy one moment and then she gets really angry like, instantly and it\u2019s been giving me headaches. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you\u2019re 17 now, Caleb, but surely you can remember how hard puberty is- ",
        "Caleb: Ick, that word. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know, it\u2019s not the most fun thing to talk about. Have you talked to Alice at all about what she\u2019s going through?",

        "Dr. Bright: Maybe. But you and Alice have always been close. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but it\u2019s - I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s different now. Her feelings feel different and they\u2019re more intense and I just- I haven\u2019t figured out how to fit them in yet. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How are her feelings different?",
        "Caleb: Well, I mean, it\u2019s still her obviously. Most of the time, there isn\u2019t any difference at all. But then there are these spikes- like she\u2019ll lose her temper at me or get really sad when she gets into a fight with her friends and I mean, she always did those things but now it\u2019s- it feels weird. Like there\u2019s an added layer of stuff on top of it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But the underlying feelings are the same? The essence of her emotional being, once you get through all the \u201cstuff\u201d. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s pretty much the same. But there\u2019s never been something between us, you know? I\u2019ve never had to try and get through fog like this before. The first time it happened - she was texting with her friend and I guess her friend said something mean and she got mad - I didn\u2019t even know where the feeling was coming from. It was so quick and so extreme that I didn\u2019t recognize her for a second. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How did you figure out it was her?",
        "Caleb: Well, once I got past that weird jolt of anger, it just felt like Alice angry. Maybe angrier than usual, but it was her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then that\u2019s what you focus on. If you\u2019re having a hard time balancing Alice\u2019s changing emotions, just focus on what\u2019s familiar. Chances are, she\u2019s having a hard time balancing them herself. It doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a different person but things might be a little bit more intense from time to time. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve felt these kinds of jolts from your classmates before, haven\u2019t you? I know your empathy didn\u2019t really start in earnest until you were 15 but you go to a big school. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I have, but- it\u2019s different when it\u2019s someone I really, really know. Like, I\u2019ve never had to worry about balancing Alice\u2019s feelings before. Once I figured out what was going on and started seeing you, home has been, like, the one place that I don\u2019t have to worry about stuff. At home, I can tell my family when their feelings are too much. I have to pretend to be normal with everyone else. Well, except for... ",

And then I\u2019ve been in football camp for the past few weeks to get ready for the season and I just. No. We haven\u2019t talked. We\u2019ve- we\u2019ve texted a little. That\u2019s how I know he was in Ohio. And he\u2019s sent me some new music and I\u2019ve snap-chatted him a bit, but you know, we haven\u2019t really had like, a conversation or anything. You\u2019re confused. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What are you trying to achieve by \u201csnap-chatting\u201d him but not talking to him?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. I mean, I wasted the last few weeks of school being so mad at him and by the time I cooled off I was away and it just...it got too hard to really reach out, you know? After- after I told him I needed space to think, he didn\u2019t try to talk to me again and I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready to talk to him so I guess I was sending him stuff to try and...I don\u2019t know, bridge the gap a bit? Make it less weird when I see him at school?",
        "Dr. Bright: You start school again next week, right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Bright: And do you plan on talking to him then?",
        "Caleb: Ugh, I don\u2019t know. I thought if I took the summer to get my head screwed on right, I would know exactly what to say and what to do. But I don\u2019t. I just...Can we just talk about something else?",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. But I would like to come back to this. You\u2019re starting senior year - are you excited?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I\u2019m excited for our last season - things went so well last year so hopefully I can go out on top. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think you\u2019ll play football in college?",
        "Caleb: No. No, I like it but, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t need it as much anymore. When things first started, football was like, this great outlet for everything - something to focus on, distract from what was happening to me. And I still like it but, I don\u2019t need that escape as much anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve learned how to cope with your ability extremely well. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, that\u2019s part of it. I mean, things have definitely gotten easier. And I believe you, you know, when you say that overall it\u2019s just going to get easier and easier the older I get. I think that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s- I think I\u2019ve learned to like it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Being an empath, you mean?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I mean, all annoying little sisters and bummed out classmates aside, it\u2019s kinda cool, right? I never realized how cool it was until- well, until Adam. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Well, not a lot of people know, right? And my parents weren\u2019t exactly thrilled to find out there was something different about me. I mean they don\u2019t think I\u2019m a freak or anything like that but, when you first told them about what you thought was going on, they got so scared. I could feel it from your waiting room. I remember going to the door to try and hear what you guys were talking about because I thought something had gone really wrong. But they- they were just worried, you know? They believed you right away, which is still so weird to me but I think they could tell that something was really off with me. I mean, you remember how hard it was at first - I thought I was gonna explode from all the feeling. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, you were under a lot of strain. ",
        "Caleb: Right, and they could tell, they were worried that there was something really wrong with me. So when you told them about the empathy thing, I felt their relief at first: that they had an explanation for why I was behaving the way I was, getting headaches, acting out. But then they got so scared and worried. And I got that. 'Cause I was scared too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s perfectly understandable, Caleb. Coming into an ability can be very difficult, especially when it presents all at once. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I mean, it was hard. But then I started working with you and got better at handling it and felt less scared about losing control, but my parents were still scared. They still are sometimes. They love me, I know that, and they wouldn\u2019t want me to be different. I actually think they\u2019re thankful for it sometimes - that I\u2019m able to understand stuff, you know, without them having to explain. But they still get scared. And more for me than for Alice - I can tell the difference.",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you think that is?",
        "Caleb: Because I can\u2019t be normal. Ever. I\u2019m always going to have a harder time with some stuff than other kids. My relationships with people are always going to be kinda weird. And it\u2019s been mostly fine so far but what is it gonna be like when I go to college and have to live with someone I don\u2019t know? Or get a job? I mean, dating Adam\u2019s hard enough and he knew about it - it\u2019s not like I can tell every person I date or hang out with. ",
        "Dr. Bright: There are many people in this world who are very sensitive. Empathy is something most of the human race experiences. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as different as you worry. ",
        "Caleb: Great, that\u2019s just what I want to be: \u201cthe sensitive guy\u201d",
        "Dr. Bright: There are worse things to be, Caleb. Society changes - men aren\u2019t expected to ignore their feelings anymore. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, yeah, you sound like my dad.",
        "Dr. Bright: Really?",
        "Caleb: Hey, you can\u2019t be surprised - you just said dudes can be sensitive. My dad is just one of those guys, I guess.",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. I just didn\u2019t realize. ",
        "Caleb: I mean, he\u2019s always been a stay-at-home dad for, like, my whole life. Like, he writes and stuff but my mom always been the, you know, breadwinner. That\u2019s a thing, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, so, my dad\u2019s always been telling me and Alice that guys should cook and clean and do all the stuff just as much as the women. And that it\u2019s okay for guys to cry and talk about their feelings and stuff - that they don\u2019t have to be all macho all the time. I mean, I remember when I told him I wanted to play football, I was so nervous, because I thought he would see it as me, like, selling out. You know, conforming to like, gender roles and all that. But he just smiled and he told me I could do whatever made me happy as long as I wasn\u2019t a dick about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: He said that?",
        "Caleb: Well, yeah, but in, you know, like, a dad way. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It seems like you have wonderful parents, Caleb. I know I\u2019ve only met them a handful of times but they love you very much. ",
        "Caleb:  Yeah, I know. But most parents want their kids to be normal, right? I mean, it\u2019s just easier.",
        "Dr. Bright: Maybe. But just because they have different things to worry about with you, doesn\u2019t mean they have more to worry about. Atypical or no, they would still be scared for you. It\u2019s what parents do.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right.",
        "Dr. Bright: How does Alice feel about your ability?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t really know. She calls me a freak sometimes, but I know she doesn\u2019t mean it. And I think she knows I know she doesn\u2019t mean it because I can feel the emotion underneath it.",
        "Dr. Bright: So it doesn\u2019t hurt your feelings when she calls you that?",
        "Caleb: No. I know it\u2019s her way of dealing with it. She definitely thinks it\u2019s weird, but she loves me anyway. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said you didn\u2019t think of your ability as cool until Adam - what did you mean by that?",
        "Caleb: Well, he\u2019s the only other person who knows, right? Well, now Chloe and Frank too, I guess, but that\u2019s different because they\u2019re both weird too. And then the only other normal person who knows is you. And you just feel kinda, I don\u2019t know, unfazed by it. I guess you deal with things that are a lot crazier than me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve met those with more extreme abilities, yes. ",
        "Caleb: But Adam thinks it\u2019s really cool. I mean, obviously he was really freaked when I first told him, you remember that whole disaster- ",
        "Dr. Bright: It wasn\u2019t a disaster once you two actually talked though, was it?",
        "Caleb: No. No, definitely not a disaster.",
        "Dr. Bright: So once he got used to the idea...",
        "Caleb: Yeah, he thought it was awesome. He like, turned it into a game sometimes. Like, Adam would make guesses about which of our classmates had crushes on each other. And then when we would see those two people talking, he would make me go stand near them and try and pick up the vibe, you know? It\u2019s, like, so dumb and it\u2019s not like we would tell anybody if the person they liked actually liked them back but - I don\u2019t know, it was fun. Sometimes it got sad though - there\u2019s a lot of unrequited crushing going on in high school. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I think I recall that from 100 years ago. ",
        "Caleb: I mean, we would do all kinds of stuff like that. Like, on big presentation days, I would go ask the teacher something before class - like, something simple - and feel what kind of mood they were in. And then I\u2019d tell Adam or give him a signal or something and then he\u2019d make his presentation so that it would fit the mood of the teacher. I like- I don\u2019t know how he did it but, based on whether they were happy or sad or annoyed or whatever, Adam could tell what kind of thing they\u2019d like the most. If a teacher was really tired, and really over it that day, Adam would get up and give a really long, like, really good presentation. And it would give that teacher, like, a break because they could just listen to one student talk for 15 minutes and actually be smart instead of sitting through 10 four minute presentations that are all copied from SparkNotes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: My goodness, it sounds like you two had a whole system in place. Did it work?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. But it made Adam happy and it\u2019s pretty fun to watch him improvise 20 minutes about Hemingway. I mean, I think he made a lot of stuff up but Mr. Collins was hungover that day so he, like, got an A. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not quite sure I approve of manipulating your teachers that way but I\u2019m also not sure a teacher should be hungover in class so, I don\u2019t know whose side I fall on. ",
        "Caleb: No, it\u2019s okay. Like, Mr. Collins is a really good teacher most of the time. But he\u2019s youngish - your age or close probably - so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s never going to go out with his friends. I mean, I assumed that\u2019s what he did and he wasn\u2019t just drinking at home. I think that would have felt different. Like, sadder. But, even though he was feeling all fuzzy and woolly and nauseous - and not the fun butterfly kind of nauseous, just, like, straight up nauseous - he also had this like, little buzz of happiness? Like what happened the night before was worth the terrible hangover.",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you know what a hangover feels like?",
        "Caleb: Movies. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you sure?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, are you kidding me? There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever gonna get drunk. At least not on purpose. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m happy to hear that, but once you get to college- ",
        "Caleb: No, I mean, I\u2019ve had alcohol before. Don\u2019t give me that look, everybody does it. I bet even you drank in high school. But the one time I drank an entire beer, it felt, like, so awful. I mean, feeling other people drunk around you is bad enough, but feeling tipsy yourself and then also the feelings of 20 drunk teenagers is, like, a nightmare. Now when I go to parties, I bring iced herbal tea with me in a flask and try to find the sober people. Or at least, the less drunk people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You put herbal tea in a flask?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I got that stuff that\u2019s supposed to de-stress you or whatever. I have no idea if it works, but it just helps having something in my hand and a reason to turn away drinks.",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, whatever works to stave off the peer pressure. ",
        "Caleb: Bringing Adam helped too. If I could focus on his feelings, everyone else didn\u2019t bother me as much. He, uh, I don't know, he grounded me. Anchored me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How so?",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s just always really easy to focus on his feelings. Even when he was really sad, he felt like- it was like being at home. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how about now? With the limited contact you two have had, how are you feeling?",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m okay. I, uh- I miss him a lot, to be totally honest. And I feel- I feel, like, really dumb. I mean, I know I overreacted but I just got so freaked. And now I feel like I kind of ruined everything - like he\u2019s not going to forgive me for what I said about his parents when I finally do talk to him.",
        "Dr. Bright: So you no longer have the same concerns about Adam\u2019s parents?",
        "Caleb: Well, no, I do. I mean, I definitely do. You know what\u2019s going on with Frank, right? You\u2019ve talked to him?",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe is still trying to convince him to come see me. But, yes, she\u2019s filled me in on what she\u2019s been able to glean about what happened. I gather he doesn\u2019t like talking about it very much. ",
        "Caleb: No, he doesn\u2019t. Especially around me. Sometimes, I think I shouldn\u2019t even be trying to help him at all. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Caleb: Well, if he\u2019s having a bad day, I think being around an empath makes his whole situation worse. Like whatever empathy he has bounces off of my empathy and then we just go round and round and it feels pretty fucking terrible. He gets really scared - last week we were both helping Chloe move some big pieces in her studio and he started yelling at me about how I needed to leave, how it was too dangerous, he couldn\u2019t protect me, just like, all this stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you do?",
        "Caleb: Well, Chloe tried to tell him he was safe, that we all were safe, that he wasn\u2019t in combat mode anymore - I guess he was having some kind of flashback? But she told me to leave and I think she handled it on her own. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. ",
        "Caleb: What? You feel mad.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry, Caleb, I\u2019m not angry at you-",
        "Caleb: I know. Trust me, I know what \u201cangry at Caleb\u201d feels like. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m just worried, that\u2019s all. I know Chloe and you are better equipped than most to know what someone in crisis needs but you\u2019re still both essentially children. ",
        "Caleb: Hey - that\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m almost 18-",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, your birthday isn\u2019t for months-",
        "Caleb: -and Chloe is 21. We\u2019re not totally incapable of dealing with serious stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know that. ",
        "Caleb: Then why are you mad?",
        "Dr. Bright: I told you, I\u2019m worried. ",
        "Caleb: C\u2019mon, I know it\u2019s not just that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. I\u2019m angry that Chloe has taken on this responsibility. She could be putting herself, and you, in danger-",
        "Caleb: Frank would never hurt her. He would never hurt anyone-",
        "Dr. Bright: That may be so, but he\u2019s still a highly volatile individual. He needs professional help. And Chloe is not a trauma specialist - she\u2019s an art student. And you\u2019re a high school student. What happened to Frank is beyond both of your expertise. ",
        "Caleb: For now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Remember when I said it might be cool to use my ability to help people? Well, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about that. I don\u2019t know, coming to therapy and talking to Adam and getting to know Frank - it\u2019s made me think about what I want to do after high school. And I think it could be good to use this weird thing I have for a career. Like, study psychology or social work in college and then use the empathy to be, like, really, really fucking good at it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think that\u2019s a wonderful idea. And I\u2019m so glad that both you and Chloe have such giving hearts. But you know you can\u2019t practice on a traumatized veteran, right?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. And that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing - I really feel for the guy, you know? Ugh, you know what I mean. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I know you what you mean. ",
        "Caleb: And it feels personal, I guess. Knowing that my boyfriend\u2019s- well, that Adam\u2019s parents are behind it, it feels like I was meant to meet him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re beginning to sound a lot like Chloe. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. But I don\u2019t buy all that universe stuff as much as she does. Just that, well, I think some people are meant for other people, you know? Like, not even in a romantic, soul-mate way. But I know Chloe thinks she was meant for Frank. They just get each other. And she helps him and he- I don\u2019t know, he gives her a purpose. Someone to take care of. I think she likes that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you feel like you\u2019re meant for Frank, too? ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, a little bit. I mean, not in the same way Chloe is. \u2018Cause I think whatever happened to Frank in his life, he would have met Chloe and they would have made art together. Even if he never went into the army. But it\u2019s like when those scientists did all that stuff to him, his life got shifted and aimed towards me. Like I became part of his story. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what role do you think you\u2019re playing in his story?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know yet. I mean, maybe it\u2019s that he\u2019s in my story - maybe it\u2019s just that I was supposed to meet him to see what could go wrong. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Well, the reason his head is all messed up, the reason he has such a hard time - it\u2019s because his empathy is out of control. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Frank was given an empath ability artificially. His biology wasn\u2019t structured for it in the same way yours is. Your body produces your ability naturally - his was injected into him, along with a lot of other things. ",
        "Caleb: Like, what kinds of things? Did Chloe tell you that?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve been looking into it independently. There\u2019s not a lot I can do to help him until he comes and sees me so I\u2019m doing what I can to figure it out. ",
        "Caleb: But it definitely was Adam\u2019s parents who did it?",
        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t been able to find that out for sure yet. ",
        "Caleb: What am I supposed to do with that? Like, how am- how can I go to Adam\u2019s house and see his parents when I know they do bad stuff to people like me?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re not in danger with them, I don\u2019t think. Do you want to get back together with Adam?",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m not even sure we ever really broke up. I mean, yeah, we haven\u2019t talked but, I don\u2019t know, I feel like we just hit pause. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been out there dating a bunch of other people or even thinking about other people- oh fuck, do you think he\u2019s been spending the whole summer dating other people?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have no idea, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Oh god, I should have said something. How am I still so bad at this?",
        "Dr. Bright: What would you have said?",
        "Caleb: \u201cPlease give me some space to freak out but also don\u2019t change your feelings about me so we can figure it out at the end of the summer\u201d?",
        "Dr. Bright: I take it he doesn\u2019t have any reason to think that\u2019s how you\u2019re feeling?",
        "Caleb: No. I mean, all the contact we\u2019ve had has been pretty...well, really fucking distant and polite - not like how we texted before. God, what if he has some better, normal, non-freak boyfriend now?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t think Adam would be so quick to forget about you, but if you want to keep seeing him you need to reach out. Have a serious conversation with him.  ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I know. I know I should but I\u2019m just- even if he hasn\u2019t forgotten about me, even if he does want to be together...I don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m kind of scared. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Because of his parents?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, it\u2019s partly that. But it\u2019s also- I mean, I didn\u2019t handle things very well, I know that. I know I should have talked to him after I freaked out, instead of just ignoring him at school, and I know that sending him snaps and stuff isn\u2019t actually communication or whatever. But I don\u2019t even know- I don't even know that I was that great of a boyfriend in the first place. I always got really overwhelmed whenever we fought and I don\u2019t know how to take care of him when he\u2019s feeling bad and I just- I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to make things worse. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Make things worse how?",
        "Caleb: For him. Because even though it\u2019s easier to balance stuff with him, when he gets down, I really don\u2019t know how to make it better. When he\u2019s sad, I can feel it, and then he gets angry at himself for making me feel sad, even when I try to tell him I\u2019d rather know what he\u2019s feeling than have him hide it from me. But it makes him self-conscious and making him feel worse is the last thing I ever want to do. Like, ever. I don\u2019t know, sometimes I think he should be with someone else. Someone normal. But then sometimes...",
        "Dr. Bright: Sometimes?",
        "Caleb: Well, I think what I was saying about some people being meant for other people, sometimes I feel that way about Adam. Not that I like, think we\u2019re gonna get married someday and spend happily ever after together or whatever but just- he\u2019s not special, you know? I mean, obviously he is, you know, special in that way every person is special, but he\u2019s not different like me. Every time I\u2019ve met another atypical, their feelings feel different to me. Sometimes it\u2019s a little, like with Chloe, and sometimes it\u2019s a huge difference, like the one time I met Damien. His feelings were, like, so strong. And then there\u2019s Frank, which is this entirely unique, consuming thing. But Adam\u2019s just a normal guy. Like, yeah, he\u2019s got his own issues that are hard to handle sometimes but so does my dad, you know, and a lot of people at school I think. But, no matter what, Adam\u2019s feelings still feel special to me. I always know when he\u2019s nearby and I can feel the smallest changes to his moods and, even when they\u2019re bad, he makes me feel good. Just like, comfortable in my own body. I like knowing how he feels. And there has to be a reason for that, right? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Does there need to be a reason?",
        "Caleb: No, I guess not. But sometimes I still worry about my own feelings being real, you know? Like if I\u2019m actually feeling things on my own or if it\u2019s just the influence of everyone around me. It\u2019s hard to know what to trust. But the way I feel about Adam - the way he\u2019s different - that means it really is mine. I really do love him, it\u2019s not just a teenage crush or my ability doing things to me. It\u2019s me. And him. And we just, we fit and we would fit even if I wasn\u2019t special, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think so?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then that\u2019s all that matters. Well, that and Adam feeling similarly. ",
        "Caleb: I think he does. We\u2019ve never said it but- I think he does. But what if how he feels isn\u2019t the right thing for him? What if I\u2019m not the right person to be there for him?",
        "Dr. Bright: You can\u2019t make that decision for him, Caleb. All you can do is love and support him the best you can. That\u2019s all any of us can do with the people in our lives.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll do my best. I can do that.",
        "Dr. Bright: So, you\u2019re going to talk to him?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ll text him. God, don\u2019t give that disappointed feeling. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I just think a phone call-",
        "Caleb: I\u2019ll text him asking to talk. Does that work? ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s a step in the right direction. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, okay.",
        "Dr. Bright: So tell me more about this lake house - did you have any other family come visit you while you were there?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, we had a couple of family friends come by...",

        "Damien: How close do you need to be? Touching?",
        "Mark: No, same room is fine. Maybe further. 31.2 feet apart is my upper limit. But that\u2019s on a good day.   ",
        "Damien: That\u2019s a very exact number. ",
        "Mark: Yeah, well, The AM is pretty exact. ",
        "Damien: They tested for that?",
        "Mark: Oh yeah. They\u2019ve got stats on stats on stats for me. They measured every single part of my body, put me in rooms with other atypicals and tried different distances, different times of day, different fucking room temperatures. I\u2019m pretty sure they know more about me than I do at this point. Which is not a fact I relish. And God knows what they did to me while I was in the other time. ",
        "Damien: You think they continued to experiment on you?",
        "Mark: Yeah, why the hell not? I don\u2019t know what they could have figured out, but they would have made use of me. It is a \u201cuse every part of the animal\u201d kind of place. ",

        "Damien: And you went?",
        "Mark: I thought they were talking about my photography. I\u2019d been applying to about a million jobs, sending my portfolio around, and they emailed me through the form on my website. Everything they said made it sound like they were a non-profit wanting to hire me as a photographer. ",
        "Damien: So you went to this meeting, under false pretenses, and they just kidnapped you?",
        "Mark: Pretty much. Yeah, yeah, that face you\u2019re making is basically how I felt about it too. I mean, no one actually sticks a needle in your neck and then throws you in a cell underground in real life, right? That\u2019s just something that happens in movies. Except- here I am. ",
        "Damien: That blows. ",

        "Damien: Jeez, sorry. ",

        "Damien: You told her about The AM?",
        "Mark: Well, not all of it. Not the stuff that they did to me. But I told her how I got there - to 1810. And then we got to talking about Camille a bit - you know, my time travel buddy-",
        "Damien: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Mark: But mostly I tried to avoid that topic. And she didn\u2019t push. She understands not wanting to talk about that stuff. ",
        "Damien: And you\u2019re sure that she was there - that she was real?",
        "Mark: Yeah, I am. The more I think about it - I spent nearly two years there and never had such vivid hallucinations. She felt really real. And even though it\u2019s such a blur, I think she\u2019s the one that pulled me out. I mean, you didn\u2019t do anything special, right? How else would I have woken up?",
        "Damien: But why would she bring you back and then not come looking for you?",
        "Mark: Maybe she couldn\u2019t find me. We haven\u2019t exactly been parading ourselves around. She\u2019s probably still with that...Dr. Bright person - the one she said she was working with. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, that\u2019s the other thing, how do you know that doctor isn\u2019t working for The AM?",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t know for certain, but I trust Sam. She might not always be the most forthcoming person in the world, but she doesn\u2019t lie. ",

        "Mark: I think we should go talk to my sister. ",
        "Damien: Mark-",
        "Mark: Yeah, I know, I know, and you don\u2019t want to go and you don\u2019t want me to go either so most of the time I don\u2019t but I just think we could get some real answers-",
        "Damien: I was in therapy with your sister for over a year- she\u2019s not exactly a forthcoming person either except she does lie-",
        "Mark: She wouldn\u2019t to me. Not after everything that\u2019s happened. And she could help me with my ability - she\u2019s done it before. I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do here, but you\u2019re not her.",
        "Damien: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea - you don\u2019t know how much contact she might still have with The AM. ",
        "Mark: I highly doubt she\u2019s still working with them - they were none too pleased with her last I saw her. ",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Mark: I saw her get fired or arrested or whatever The AM\u2019s version is. She found me and it set off an alarm and a bunch of security took her away. And the whole place freaked out about it. I knew Joanie was good at her job but apparently she was the rising star of the whole place. For her to breach a high security area and then try and break out a subject was a big deal. ",
        "Damien: She tried to break you out?",
        "Mark: I- yeah, I think so. I mean, she was pretty paralyzed with shock at first, I think, but she started to move towards me and yeah, of course she would have broken me out, she\u2019s my sister. But then the alarms went off and they grabbed her and it was all anybody talked about for weeks. ",
        "Damien: Wait, how do you know that? I can\u2019t imagine you were standing around the water cooler with your captors. ",
        "Mark: There was a guard. He was kind - really kind, actually. He would bring me extra food, actually decent eats, from the employee cafeteria - keep me updated on the news, that kind of stuff. ",
        "Damien: Why?",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t really know. I tried to crack a couple of jokes my first few weeks there - what Joanie would call my defense mechanism. And he liked it - he laughed. And then he would just come talk to me. We\u2019re about the same age and I think he was bored - he was a patrol guard, so his job was basically to walk up and down the hallway and stand at doors - I provided decent conversation. By the time I went into the coma, we were friends. Hell, under different circumstances- well. They would have had to be very different circumstances. ",
        "Damien: I think I met him. ",
        "Mark: What?",
        "Damien: When I came to get you out, I, um, well I did my thing with the guards, you know-",
        "Mark: Right-",
        "Damien: And there was this guy who told me not to hurt you. Even through what I was doing, he was able to tell me that. ",
        "Mark: Yeah that sounds like Charlie. ",
        "Damien: I\u2019m glad you had a friend in there. ",
        "Mark: Thanks, man. It definitely made things a little easier. ",
        "Damien: Did he ever try and help you escape?",
        "Mark: No. I never asked. ",
        "Damien: Why not?",
        "Mark: I didn\u2019t want to get him in trouble, I guess.",
        "Damien: So you think he would have done it?",
        "Mark: Yeah, probably. ",
        "Damien: Because he liked you. ",
        "Mark: Yeah. ",
        "Damien: Because of your ability?",
        "Mark: No, because of my personality. ",
        "Damien: Oh. ",
        "Mark: I\u2019m just a normal guy by myself. I can\u2019t make people like me. I\u2019m not like-",
        "Damien: You\u2019re not like me. ",
        "Mark: Well, yeah. Oh c\u2019mon, don\u2019t make that face. But if I\u2019m being totally honest, I\u2019m not sure I would have stayed if you hadn\u2019t wanted me to. At least at first.",
        "Damien: And now?",
        "Mark: You\u2019re alright. I mean, you\u2019ve taken pretty good care of me, a complete stranger. But don\u2019t you have a life you should be getting back to? A job? A family? How can you take 2 months off to bounce around cheap motels helping a guy recover from a supernatural coma?",
        "Damien: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. ",
        "Mark: Yeah, I know. But you also want me to trust you, which I do, because that\u2019s the way it works, but if you want me to trust you for real, you need to give me a reason. Other than your ability. ",
        "Damien: What do you want to know?",
        "Mark: Why are you doing this?",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Mark: This - breaking me out, helping me get better, listening to me talk about The AM. You\u2019re not a therapist-",
        "Damien: Definitely not.",
        "Mark: You\u2019re not a scientist, you said The AM hasn\u2019t done anything to you, so why get involved? Just to piss off my sister?",
        "Damien: Not entirely. ",
        "Mark: Okay, then...",
        "Damien: There aren\u2019t other people like me. ",
        "Mark: Not to burst your bubble, dude, but I just spent the past four years in a place full of people like you-",
        "Damien: Other atypicals, yeah, but did you ever meet anybody who had my specific ability?",
        "Mark: No. But that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, I know that. But I don\u2019t know how to find them. So when I found out what you could do...",
        "Mark: What, you wanted a buddy? A partner in crime?",
        "Damien: We haven\u2019t committed any crimes. Well, since getting you out that is.",
        "Mark: Yeah, not yet. But you get this gleam in your eye any time we talk about The AM.",
        "Damien: I just wondered what it would be like: to be around someone like me. ",
        "Mark: God, I must be quite a disappointment to you then.",
        "Damien: What do you mean?",
        "Mark: Because I can\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m broken. ",
        "Damien: For now, yeah. But you don\u2019t think your ability is gone for good, right?",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t know. Hey listen, man, I get it. If I hadn\u2019t had Joanie growing up, I would have felt really alone too. ",
        "Damien: But she isn\u2019t like us. ",
        "Mark: No, she\u2019s not. Which, for someone like me, is sort of a relief sometimes. Around her, I don\u2019t have to worry about accidentally setting something on fire or walking through walls. But she didn\u2019t care when I did. Joanie never cared that I was different. ",
        "Damien: Sure, because of the way you\u2019re different. She definitely doesn\u2019t seem to like my particular brand of different. ",
        "Mark: Yeah, because you can be kind of a dick about it sometimes. My sister doesn\u2019t suffer assholes. ",
        "Damien: I haven\u2019t been an asshole to you! I\u2019m helping you!  ",
        "Mark: Yes, I know, and I\u2019m grateful for that. But you\u2019re also weirdly demanding. You just expect me to go along with you on whatever you want to do. ",
        "Damien: Can you blame me? That\u2019s how my entire life works.",
        "Mark: Sure. But after a while, isn\u2019t that just a convenient excuse?",
        "Damien: You don\u2019t know anything about me. ",
        "Mark: Oh, and whose fault is that? I\u2019m trying to get to know you. I don\u2019t know what else to do. ",
        "Damien: Alright, slow your roll. We\u2019ve gotten way off track. ",
        "Mark: You\u2019re right. Can you stop doing that? ",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Mark: You wanting me to talk about The AM it\u2019s- maybe I don\u2019t want to relive every terrible thing that happened to me in the past four years.",
        "Damien: But you need to. You\u2019re, you know, traumatized.",
        "Mark: God, you sound like Joanie. You think you can fix this? Do you also have a degree in psychology? Actually, you could I guess, I don\u2019t know anything about you, which brings us back to what I want to talk about-",
        "Damien: Yeah, well, you can\u2019t always get what you want.",
        "Mark: Unless you\u2019re you. ",
        "Damien: Hey, it\u2019s not always a blessing, okay? Once you\u2019re better and you can do it with me, you\u2019ll understand. ",
        "Mark: Oh, so that\u2019s what this is about? Pulling someone else into your weird pity party? ",
        "Damien: I\u2019m not having a pity party! ",
        "Mark: Yes, you are! You want me to feel bad for you right now - I can feel it, remember? ",
        "Damien: See? Okay, this is what I\u2019m talking about - my ability isn\u2019t always a good thing. ",
        "Mark: What, because people can feel what you want? Want what you want? Want to make you happy, meet your needs? God, yeah, that must be awful- ",
        "Damien: Yeah, yeah, sometimes it is! ",
        "Mark: How? How could that be a bad thing?",
        "Damien: Because sometimes people take it too far. ",
        "Mark: What are you talking about? You want me to care? You know what they say - caring is sharing. ",
        "Damien: Shut up. ",
        "Mark: Damien. What do you mean? Who took it too far? ",
        "Damien: I told them I wanted to be left alone and they listened. They left and they never came back. ",
        "Mark: Who?",
        "Damien: My parents. ",
        "Mark: Your parents?",
        "Damien: When I was 13, I got into a fight with them about something and - the thing is I didn\u2019t have good control over it back then, when it first started. It was stronger too. We were fighting and I told them to leave me alone and they did. Forever. ",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t understand. I thought your ability wears off - that once you\u2019re no longer near someone it doesn\u2019t-",
        "Damien: Yeah, it doesn\u2019t work after a while. But it lingered for longer back then. They drove away pretty fast. By the time it wore off, who knows how far they\u2019d gotten. ",
        "Mark: But surely they would have come back.",
        "Damien: You\u2019d think, right?",
        "Mark: They didn\u2019t?",
        "Damien: Nope. Guess they probably came back to their senses in the car and realized they\u2019d been given the perfect excuse. They had a demanding freak of a son. He wanted to be left alone? Fine. I\u2019m sure they were relieved. ",
        "Mark: How- how could they do that?",
        "Damien: What, you have a perfect relationship with your parents?",
        "Mark: No. But they didn\u2019t abandon me when I was just a kid. ",
        "Damien: From what your sister's told me, they kind of did. ",
        "Mark: What? No, there\u2019s no way that she would have told you about that. Unless, you made her.",
        "Damien: I was curious. ",
        "Mark: Jesus, and you wonder why Joanie doesn\u2019t like your particular brand of different.  ",
        "Damien: What? I wanted to know if we had any common ground. ",
        "Mark: It\u2019s not at all the same thing. Our parents didn\u2019t leave us. They were just...they weren\u2019t particularly attentive, okay? There are way worse things in the world. Clearly. What did you do after they left? Where did you go?",
        "Damien: I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. I want you to tell me-",
        "Mark: The director of The AM would come and talk to me every now and then. Well, one of the directors. The director of the facility I was in, anyway. ",
        "Damien: That\u2019s not Agent Green is it?",
        "Mark: Definitely not. But I did see him from time to time. He worked with some of the other atypicals on my hall and we sometimes did experiments together. That guy was terrified of me. I have no idea why. It\u2019s not like I could do anything to him but he always excused himself whenever we were in the same room.",
        "Damien: I think I know why that is. ",
        "Mark: Really?",
        "Damien: I\u2019m pretty sure he and your sister used to be a thing. ",
        "Mark: Oh really? That another thing that you forced out of her?",
        "Damien: It doesn\u2019t make it any less true.",
        "Mark: Oh god, are you serious? Joanie did always have the worst taste in men. ",
        "Damien: So the director?",
        "Mark: Right, yeah. Director Wadsworth. It\u2019s not that she enjoyed inflicting pain on anybody, because I don\u2019t think that she did. There were a couple of scientists who definitely got a kick out of how much we squirmed, but Wadsworth...she\u2019s all about that bottom line. How much progress is being made, how close they are to a break through, how much profit they can make off of it. She is ruthless. But also incredibly sharp - she would come in and pinpoint exactly the variable that needed to be changed in order to make something work. And she was always coming up with new ways to combine powers, see how they worked together. That\u2019s where I came in, usually.",
        "Damien: What do you mean?",
        "Mark: I\u2019d be in a room with a few different atypicals, told to try out their powers, see what I could do, try and use them all at once. That kind of stuff. All the while, they\u2019d be monitoring every single system in my body - my heart rate, my brain waves, you name it. ",
        "Damien: What were they trying to figure out?",
        "Mark: Anything. Everything. They tried extracting powers from people, putting them into someone else. I think the military was funding some project along those lines. ",
        "Damien: Extracting?",
        "Mark: Yep. ",
        "Damien: They do that with you?",
        "Mark: Couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s too risky - you can\u2019t remove someone\u2019s power completely, but a lot of stuff went wrong in the process of trying to duplicate it. I\u2019m too rare. They only did that kind of stuff with powers they had a lot of access to. Pyrokinesis and mind reading, that kind of stuff. ",
        "Damien: And then they would just shove the power into somebody else?",
        "Mark: Basically. ",
        "Damien: Did it work?",
        "Mark: I\u2019m not sure. I think so. I wasn\u2019t really part of that stage of it. They would pair me with the atypical that had had the power extracted. See if their power still worked. It usually did once the person was recovered enough, but sometimes it took a while. The procedure is invasive.",
        "Damien: Did they ever get invasive with you?",
        "Mark: Yeah, I don't want to talk about this anymore, I think I\u2019m done. ",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. I am tired, my body hurts, and now I\u2019m sad. So please just- just let me lie down and leave me alone for a bit. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, yeah, of course. Sorry. ",
        "Mark: Wow, an actual apology. I must look terrible. ",
        "Damien: You have gotten pretty pale. I\u2019ll go out and get us some food. Just-",

While she still gets overwhelmed in crowds or by certain individuals, she is able to filter the incoming thoughts with excellent precision. As such, we conduct many of our conversations over the phone. The patient wants to discuss the obstacles she encounters in her daily life but we find it hard to do so productively when she can hear all my thoughts. However, she still comes in every month or so to check in and flex her ability. We often discuss her friend, Frank, which is becoming an increasingly frustrating topic as I have not yet-",

        "Chloe: Sorry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s perfectly alright. How\u2019s school going?",
        "Chloe: Good! I\u2019m having to make up a couple of the big lecture classes that I dropped out of last semester and yeah, I definitely still get overwhelmed sometimes when I\u2019m surrounded by that many people. But I figured out that if I sit in the front row, then I\u2019m near all the students who are really concentrating on the lecture. And then if their thoughts distract me, it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s about the material! It\u2019s great, I basically don\u2019t have to take notes at all - I\u2019m just recording the lectures and then absorbing all the thoughts around me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad recording has become such a beneficial tool for you. ",
        "Chloe: It really has - that was a great idea, thank you. It\u2019s really nice to lie on my bed at the end of the day and listen back to my classes, or conversations I\u2019ve had, and just take the time to process everything. It\u2019s weird, with everyone else\u2019s thoughts coming into my head all day, I don\u2019t really get to focus on my own until I\u2019m by myself. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you had any success with shutting off the incoming thoughts completely?",
        "Chloe: Not yet. I keep trying to think of it like you told me - like a tap that I have to turn off but I just, I can\u2019t find the source. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Chloe: Well, if the thoughts are water coming out of the tap, then I just have to turn off the faucet to stop them flowing into me, right?",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s the idea. ",
        "Chloe: But water from a faucet comes from one place. The thoughts are coming from everywhere. I can\u2019t find the faucet handle to turn them off, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Hm, then maybe thinking about the thoughts as water from a tap is the wrong approach. If they are intruding from all sides, maybe it would be better to put up walls, create a fortress around your mind that you can put up and take down as you wish. ",
        "Chloe: That sounds a little extreme. I don\u2019t like the idea of putting up walls. I don\u2019t want to shut myself off from the world. Not now that I\u2019m finally getting comfortable with it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m just not that person. I\u2019m not the person who has to put up defenses and be cold to people just to get through the day. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Chloe: You\u2019re worried that I meant you. That I think you\u2019re cold and walled off. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you don\u2019t?",
        "Chloe: Well, you might not be the warmest person in the world, but I understand. I understand why you put walls up. I probably would too if I were you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not sure whether I find that a comfort or not. ",
        "Chloe: But I didn\u2019t mean you specifically. I\u2019ve just seen so many people hide away and I don\u2019t want to do that. I want to be open to what the world has to offer me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. If you don\u2019t want to work on blocking out the thoughts entirely, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s up to you to decide what we work on. ",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t know. Right now- right now, I feel good. I know it won\u2019t always be easy, but things have been so much better recently. Even being in campus housing this year has been nice - I mean, I have a single but I\u2019m still surrounded by people and it feels okay. I think- I actually think not blocking out the thoughts has been helpful - just letting them in has made it easier to manage. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sometimes it\u2019s important to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. ",
        "Chloe: Exactly! Once I stopped trying to resist it, it got easier. Like, right now I can sit and have a conversation with you and yes, sometimes I get distracted by your thoughts and I can hear Frank and Sarah out in the waiting room, but I don\u2019t feel like my head is going to explode. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I am very glad to hear that, Chloe. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not. Sarah is used to dealing with all sorts of people and Frank sounds like a very nice young man. I feel as if I already know him with everything you\u2019ve told me. ",
        "Chloe: I think you\u2019ll like him. Yeah, I know it took a long time to get him in here, but I think you\u2019ll be able to help him too. ",

        "Chloe: Should I go get him?",
        "Dr. Bright: If you\u2019d like. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?",

        "Chloe: I am involved, Dr. Bright. Even if I wasn\u2019t your patient, even if I wasn\u2019t friends with Sam, there\u2019s still Frank to consider, not to mention the fact that I\u2019m a telepath. From everything I\u2019ve learned in the past few months, it doesn\u2019t seem like any atypical can avoid being tangled up in The AM, one way or another. ",

        "Chloe: I would have heard it whether or not you said it out loud. I think we\u2019ve moved past the normal doctor-patient relationship at this point. I think we passed it a while ago.",

        "Dr. Bright: Well thank you.. ",
        "Chloe: Just because you\u2019ve done some bad things doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. My morality isn\u2019t as black and white as you think it is. I\u2019m not naive. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I understand that - I don\u2019t really like talking about myself either. Would it help if we structured it? If you thought about it as a kind of debriefing?",
        "Frank: Okay. Sure. That sounds fine, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Wonderful. Why don\u2019t we start at the beginning. Why did you choose to join the military?",
        "Frank: My father was a Marine - fought in the Gulf War. And well, there\u2019s a long tradition of service in the Sawyer family. My great-grandfather fought with the 369th in the First World War. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The 369th? Otherwise known as the Harlem Hellfighters, correct?",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: My father was a bit of a war history buff. That is quite the family heritage. ",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. Guess we\u2019ve always been pioneers. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I understand your military experience was different from most.",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "Dr. Bright: Were you excited to join?",
        "Frank: I was proud to fulfill the family duty but it was more my father\u2019s dream than mine. I know Chloe\u2019s told you about our making art together - that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I wanted to go to art school. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You paint, correct?",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. Oils mostly, though I dabble in watercolor. My grandmother taught me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you didn\u2019t go to art school?",
        "Frank: No, I did not. Me and my dad argued a lot about it but finally he agreed to help me pay for art school if I served first. The war had been going for a few years, and my dad wanted me to go over there and do my part while I could. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How long were you over there?",
        "Frank: I was in the Marines for 9 years. Enlisted when I was 18, did three tours before coming back and training with a special unit. I did four more tours with them before getting out last year. ",
        "Dr. Bright: When you say special unit, what do you mean?",
        "Frank: It was a combat unit of nine highly skilled Marines. Seven men, two women. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Two women? In combat positions?",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. This was a- a unique unit. Not strictly on the books, you understand? ",
        "Dr. Bright: I do. And you\u2019re comfortable telling me about it?",
        "Frank: It is confidential but from everything Chloe\u2019s told me about you, you\u2019re not overly concerned with having secrets. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I suppose that\u2019s fair. Tell me more about this unit. In what other ways was it unique?",
        "Frank: It was top secret and highly experimental. On my third tour with the marines, a general started coming around and interviewing each of us. Asking us questions about our experience, evaluating our skills. We started getting regular physical exams, getting lots of blood drawn, that kind of stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They were screening you. ",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. They wanted to find dedicated, skilled soldiers who were willing to try something new. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you volunteered?",
        "Frank: I did. I was planning to serve my minimum four years and then get out but I liked it. I guess natural talent for military really does run in my family. I was good at it. Very good at it, actually, if you\u2019ll excuse my lack of modesty. But it was more than that - I liked the people I worked with. It gave me- it gave me a purpose, which I guess I liked. It gave me a family. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you mean?",
        "Frank: Growing up it was just my dad, my nana, and me. They both loved me and cared for me, but that sense of family, of being part of something bigger, I didn\u2019t find that until the Marines. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But didn\u2019t joining a new unit mean leaving your military family?",
        "Frank: A part of it, sure. But it\u2019s like leaving your home to go stay with your cousins - it\u2019s just a degree of separation. And I knew this new unit would be doing important work. I wanted to be a part of that; to fight for my family, protect them.",
        "Dr. Bright: What happened after you volunteered?",
        "Frank: Well, I had to meet with a lot more people - doctors, psychologists, folks from the DOD. I was going to be a big investment - they had to make sure they weren\u2019t throwing their money away. Make sure I was fit for it. And I\u2019m proud to say that I was.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Fit for what? ",
        "Frank: The experiments they were doing. It is my understanding that you may know some of the scientists involved - the Hayes.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve never met them.",
        "Frank: But you know their boy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I do. ",
        "Frank: Right, well, um, they were just two of the brains behind the trials. It was a big operation. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And what were these trials for exactly?",
        "Frank: They were an attempt to make small units more cohesive, to create a sort of group-think that would make soldiers more effective together. ",
        "Dr. Bright: An attempt? They didn\u2019t work?",
        "Frank: Well, no, they did, ma\u2019am, but not like they planned. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Would you mind walking me through these trials? What exactly did they do?",
        "Frank: Well, Chloe told me the Hayes were working with an organization called The AM - some kind of group that works with people like her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s right. ",
        "Frank: I didn\u2019t know that at the time and- all I knew was that the DOD had created a chemical compound that was supposed to enhance empathy and higher brain functioning. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Enhance it how?",
        "Frank: I\u2019m not a scientist, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m not sure how it worked. But it made us more connected. ",
        "Dr. Bright: \u201cUs\u201d being your unit?",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. The experiment was called Project Unity. The idea was that we\u2019d function better if we were all connected on a neurological level. They injected all of us with this compound. I guess it was made from people like Chloe and Caleb. Not from people- from their blood or their DNA or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They took a piece of the atypical biology and then manufactured an artificial strain of a Class A power. ",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t know that I follow completely, ma\u2019am, but that sounds about right. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure Chloe told you that I used to work for The AM. I remember hearing about this kind of work, though I wasn\u2019t aware it had made it to the human trial stage. ",
        "Frank: It did. And by all accounts, it worked. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You felt connected to your fellow soldiers?",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. The experiment was done in stages. Injections and training, then more injections and more training. By the time we were redeployed, we had a kind of mind meld going on. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Could you describe that for me?",
        "Frank: It was very useful to have in combat situations. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Useful how?",
        "Frank: We barely had to use radios, we could be out of each other\u2019s sight lines and still be able to communicate. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Telepathically?",
        "Frank: I wouldn\u2019t say that, ma\u2019am. We weren\u2019t reading each other\u2019s minds. Maybe it seemed like that at the time but now that I\u2019ve met Chloe, I know that\u2019s not what we were doing. We were just able to anticipate each other\u2019s movements, know when someone was in a bad spot, that kind of thing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How did it feel to be able to do that?",
        "Frank: Like I said, it was damn useful. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Frank, I know I said to treat this like a debriefing, but you\u2019re not talking to one of your superiors. You can tell me how things affected you, how you feel - I want to know. ",
        "Frank: It\u2019s not- it\u2019s not easy for me to talk about, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I understand. But I think it\u2019s important to try. That\u2019s how we begin to heal.",
        "Frank: Of course, ma\u2019am. And I\u2019m aware that I\u2019ve got my fair share of problems but I\u2019m doing much better now.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very glad to hear that, Frank. You\u2019re staying at the VA?",
        "Frank: I was. They helped me get back on my feet. I saw a counselor there for a bit but they couldn\u2019t fully understand what happened to me. Chloe thought you might have a better chance. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I certainly hope to be of help. ",
        "Frank: I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t pay you, ma\u2019am. Chloe\u2019s offered but I\u2019m already staying at her house and I don\u2019t want to demand too much of her generosity. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s alright, Frank. I take on pro bono patients from time to time - you don\u2019t need to worry about it. You\u2019ve been staying with Chloe?",
        "Frank: At her house, yes. She\u2019s in dorms for the semester and so Mrs. Turner offered to put me up while I look for a job. She\u2019s letting me stay in Chloe\u2019s room.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s very kind of her. ",
        "Frank: There\u2019s nothing untoward, ma\u2019am. Chloe\u2019s a very beautiful young woman but I\u2019m not- you don\u2019t have to worry about me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I wasn\u2019t worrying. ",
        "Frank: Because Chloe doesn\u2019t do that sort of thing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, that. But also, she\u2019s a very good judge of character. If she trusts you, then I do as well. ",
        "Frank: That\u2019s good. I didn\u2019t mean to be defensive, but I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea. Some of the folks in her studio have- well, they\u2019ve made some off-color comments. About our relationship. I guess they don\u2019t know Chloe all that well. Or they just don\u2019t get it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Some people find asexuality a difficult concept to grasp.",
        "Frank: I imagine that\u2019s true, ma\u2019am. They mean well - her art friends. But I don\u2019t think they understand our relationship much and the lack of understanding is mutual. I may paint, but I don\u2019t have a lot in common with college art kids. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I suppose you don\u2019t. Have you been socializing with anyone else? People at the VA - other soldiers?",
        "Frank: I go to meetings at the Vet center sometimes, hear other peoples\u2019 stories. It helps. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How about your old unit? Do you still talk to them?",
        "Frank: They\u2019re all dead, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m- I\u2019m very sorry to hear that, Frank. ",

        "Dr. Bright: But you said yourself that a standard counselor couldn\u2019t quite understand what happened in those trials. I\u2019ve worked with many empaths - it sounds like you have a similar disposition. Whether genetic or engineered, it makes no difference to me. ",
        "Frank: You\u2019d have to hear a lot of very bad stuff, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t want to burden you with it. ",

        "Sam: What does that mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: The Director - Wadsworth - wants me back. I\u2019ve told her in no uncertain terms that that won\u2019t happen but I\u2019m not sure it will always be a choice. ",

        "Dr. Bright: No. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll try to imprison him again. Even still, I think it\u2019s important to stay in their good graces. Or at least not actively piss them off. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Hence my concern. When that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s easy to abuse drinking in order to achieve that calm. But for other atypicals, it exacerbates the problem. Makes them more vulnerable, more prone to outbursts. ",

        "Sam: But they know way more than us, right? I mean...I didn\u2019t realize how small my world was. What with having traveled all over the globe and all through time, I didn\u2019t think I needed to expand my perspective. But these past few months...I\u2019ve had this weird tunnel vision my entire life. Yes, I\u2019ve seen more of the world and history than most but it\u2019s like watching a movie. I don\u2019t actually know what the world is like, what people are like. Every time I went up to someone to show them Mark\u2019s picture my heart would start racing and my palms would sweat and I would have to do everything I could to hold on to the present. Talking to people terrifies me. Being out in the world, in the present, terrifies me. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Then what does this have to do with The AM?",
        "Sam: Just that I\u2019m beginning to understand how little I know. Not even just about the world and people but about myself. About this bigger thing that I\u2019m a part of.",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Sam: Atypicals. I always thought it was just me. Which, I realize is completely ridiculous because why would I have this unbelievable ability that defies the laws of physics and the universe if everyone else on earth was normal? But I never thought about it before. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve been very isolated for a very long time, Sam. ",
        "Sam: I know, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And now I want to understand other atypicals - I want to know how I fit into this population. I know I\u2019m a Class D but what does that even really mean? What other kinds of abilities fall into Class D? Why are some people atypical? How many of us are there? How did it start?",
        "Dr. Bright: And you think The AM has the answers?",
        "Sam: I\u2019m not saying I want to waltz in there and volunteer, but I just have so many questions. I\u2019ve been on a lot of trips in the past few months, especially in the last couple of weeks, and I\u2019ve seen some really weird stuff. And it\u2019s made me think that maybe I haven\u2019t been paying attention to my surroundings for a long time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What kinds of things have you seen?",
        "Sam: Well, there was this room where I could actually touch things and there was a man there who could see me and talk to me - I\u2019m still not sure it wasn\u2019t a dream but I guess he was another time traveler? ",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Sam: Yeah, I- I entered some kind of dimensional pocket or something. Like, an in-between place. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t there for very long. ",
        "Dr. Bright: A dimensional pocket...",
        "Sam: Yeah, there were no doors or walls or light at all. It was like a vacuum. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That is highly irregular. ",
        "Sam: My life is highly irregular.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Fair enough. ",
        "Sam: And then, last week, I was in a jungle somewhere - maybe the Amazon? I thought I recognized one or two of the bird species...but anyway, I\u2019m not sure what century it was but I came across a group of people, some kind of tribe, and...well, I didn\u2019t understand anything they were saying, they weren\u2019t speaking any language that I recognized but...they were. It was unbelievable, there were seven atypicals with them. At least. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Seven? Out of how many?",
        "Sam: Twenty? Maybe? And the atpycials were just...part of the group. They were lighting fires and moving large branches to make shelters- ",
        "Dr. Bright: A pyrokinetic and a telekinetic- ",
        "Sam: Yeah, and I think some of them could communicate non-verbally, so telepaths too. And it was so seamless - the atypicals and the regular people working together. It didn\u2019t seem to freak anyone out, it was just part of their lives. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Fascinating. ",
        "Sam: Isn\u2019t it? I mean, how many isolated cultures are there around the world like that? Communities that are aware of atypicals and live side by side with them, take advantage of their powers. Or- I don\u2019t know, maybe this tribe wasn\u2019t in a recent time, maybe it was centuries ago, millennia ago, but then how did the human race go from that to just forgetting about atypicals? Was there a major decline in the population at some point, were atypicals only found in certain geographic locations? How did we go from being integrated in society to not existing publicly at all?",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, Sam, slow down. Have you seen aytpicals in the past before?",
        "Sam: Not that I can remember but...it\u2019s possible? Like I said, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve been as observant as I thought I was. But I want to be. I want to find out more about atypicals. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, I can probably fill in some of the gaps. I have been studying the subject for most of my adult life after all. ",
        "Sam: You\u2019d do that?",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. There\u2019s plenty of information I can give you - facts, statistics - without revealing any specifics about my other patients, past and present. ",
        "Sam: That would be great. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, I\u2019m curious - you quit your job before you left, correct?",
        "Sam: Yeah. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you have a plan for what to do next?",
        "Sam: Not really. It occurred to me about thirty miles outside of the city that I was coming back to unemployment. And I understand what a luxury that is- to forget that I didn\u2019t have a job but...I do want to do something with my life. Something productive, worthwhile.",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you want to be when you grew up?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. After the trips started, I stopped thinking about the future. But when I was really little...I don\u2019t know, I thought it\u2019d be fun to work in a museum. I don\u2019t much care for them now - I go sometimes to fill in the blanks of a trip - but when I was a kid, I used to love the Natural History Museum. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Me too. ",
        "Sam: I like how ordered museums are, you know? I guess that\u2019s why I went into library science-",

        "Sam: Exactly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you thought about maybe doing that with atypicals?",
        "Sam: It\u2019s certainly crossed my mind recently, yeah. I wouldn\u2019t know where to start though. And I mean, is that really a job?",
        "Dr. Bright: Make it one. ",
        "Sam: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, you\u2019re in a very unique position. As I understand it, you don\u2019t need to work for money right now, maybe for a while - so why not take this time to start documenting atpycials through time. We have a good amount of information about atypicals existing in the world today, but having a primary source for how atypical biology has evolved through time would be invaluable. You have the research skill set already. I can guide you on some of the more scientific aspects and tell you what to look for. ",
        "Sam: And then I would take trips and try and find atypicals? ",
        "Dr. Bright: We\u2019d have to figure out a way to determine the best places and times to travel to so you\u2019re not jumping blind but, yes, that\u2019s the idea. ",
        "Sam: That\u2019s...that\u2019s more than I expected. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be on board with you researching this?",
        "Sam: I wasn\u2019t sure. I mean, when it first popped into my head, I thought maybe I\u2019m not objective enough - that the fact that I\u2019m atypical means I\u2019m too close to the subject matter. And then I thought that maybe you wouldn\u2019t want me to get more involved in all this stuff - I mean, this is The AM\u2019s main purpose, right? To find out as much about atypicals as possible?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, it is. But, as you said, you are involved by the very fact that you\u2019re atypical. And I think that actually makes you perfect as a researcher - you\u2019re uniquely suited for this work. Well, and you\u2019re one of the only people in the world who could actually do this work. ",
        "Sam: Right. Yeah. So...how do we do this? Make a list of potential time periods? I was thinking that maybe witch trials-",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, that could definitely be a good place to start. Any time with a high level of suspicion in populations is probably worth looking for. Where have you been going recently? You said you\u2019ve been on a lot of trips - were you trying to begin this research?",
        "Sam: Um, no. Not exactly. The trips...haven\u2019t been on purpose. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, that\u2019s partly why I came back, actually. I wasn\u2019t comfortable driving long distances anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam...are you alright?",
        "Sam: I don\u2019t know. No. Now I guess I have to find a new therapist...",
        "Dr. Bright: Just because you aren\u2019t officially my patient anymore, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t tell me things. I\u2019m still your friend. ",
        "Sam: Still? Were we ever really friends to begin with? Oh, god, I\u2019m sorry, that was really harsh. I just mean...well, we worked together mostly out of circumstance, right? Because we both wanted the same thing, we needed each other\u2019s help. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam...I care about you. Not just as a former patient or someone who cares for my brother, but as a person. ",
        "Sam: You do?",
        "Dr. Bright: That surprises you?",
        "Sam: A little. And not because I don\u2019t care about you too - I do. I...I don\u2019t always trust you. But I do worry about you. I want you to be safe. I want you to be, you know, happy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then should it be such a surprise that I want the same for you?",
        "Sam: I\u2019m just not used to that. I haven\u2019t had people in my life who were there just because. When we were planning everything...well, I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d still care to see me once we\u2019d gotten Mark out. Once I stopped...you know, being useful.",
        "Dr. Bright: Relationships aren\u2019t about someone\u2019s usefulness to you. We form relationships with people because we like them, we enjoy their company, we feel good around them. How about Chloe? She\u2019s a good friend, isn\u2019t she?",
        "Sam: Yeah, she is. But...she\u2019s Chloe, you know? She cares about literally every person in the world. She can\u2019t not. ",
        "Dr. Bright: She does have an unbelievably large heart. And Mark?",
        "Sam: He also seems to have a big heart problem. But...I don\u2019t know. I think he cares - really cares, not just because I helped him get out. But I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just remembering what I want to. I would understand if he didn\u2019t. I failed him, you know? From the moment I met him all the way through now, I failed him. I wasn\u2019t honest with him, I kept things from him, I couldn\u2019t find him-",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, you got him out, you kept him company-",
        "Sam: But I should have been better. It was just so new - feeling that way about someone, what you said about feeling good around someone. I didn\u2019t know it was possible to look forward to a person that much - to talking to them, seeing their face, just being near them. And I didn\u2019t know what to do, how to act, what to say. I should have just told him everything, told him I knew you, told him I knew who he was. That would have been the normal person thing to do. But I didn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m not a normal person. And I\u2019m not even talking about the fact that I time travel. I\u2019m just not a normal person in any sense. I\u2019m not a whole, functioning human being. I get nauseous when I have to make a phone call or when I make eye contact with someone on the bus. I don\u2019t know how to talk to people, I don\u2019t know how to tell someone how I feel about them, or figure out if they feel the same way. And Mark made me feel normal because he\u2019s so...so...",
        "Dr. Bright: Nice?",
        "Sam: No...well, I mean, yes, he is nice but that\u2019s not a big enough word for it, is it? He\u2019s deeply kind and compassionate, but not in the way that Chloe is, not in that big, open heart kind of way. It\u2019s quiet and it makes you feel special and...well, I\u2019ve never seen him interact with any other humans, but I bet he\u2019s really good at it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I would definitely describe him as a people person, yes. Much more so than I. ",
        "Sam: Right, exactly! I could tell that just by being one-on-one with him - he made me feel so comfortable. He smiled at me and asked me about myself and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. He didn\u2019t make me feel scrutinized or judged. And how did I return the favor? I lied to him and let him get kidnapped. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, you can\u2019t take all the blame. You are not responsible for what happened to Mark. ",

        "Agent Green: But breaking into a secure server so you can find out more about atypical biology, that\u2019s justifiable? You\u2019re not as good of a hacker as you think you are, Ms. Barnes. ",
        "Sam: I have a right to know. ",
        "Agent Green: I don\u2019t disagree. I\u2019ve long been an advocate of a more general education program. We have personalized lessons for each atypical that partakes in our programs, but there isn\u2019t a WebMD for atypicals. I think a database like that would be- would be very useful. ",

If we can help the majority of people achieve something close to a good, healthy life it\u2019s worth it. Even if it's at the cost of a few. I don\u2019t like it anymore than you do, and I do everything I can to ensure that no one is harmed, but sometimes things happen. Sometimes they need to happen. It\u2019s...natural selection.

        "Chloe: Okay, I\u2019m starting a new voice memo because I finally have the studio to myself and I need to talk through some stuff while it\u2019s all still fresh in my mind. My first studio project is due at the end of next week and Patty is letting me continue work on my sculpture from last semester - the exploding head one. And I still like it but...I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not feeling it as much as I was. Which I guess is a good thing but...",
        "It\u2019s hard! It\u2019s hard sticking to my own vision of something when I\u2019m seeing and hearing everyone else\u2019s. Francesca is doing a bust sculpture as well - less deconstructed, and part of a bigger series on identity - but her ideas are so interesting that sometimes they find a way into my head and I forget they aren\u2019t mine. So this is for future you: Chloe, the idea about using instamorph to continually remold the sculpture is Francesca\u2019s. You\u2019re using clay and steel. Don\u2019t get distracted. ",
        "I\u2019m so worried that one of these days I\u2019m going to create something and not even realize I\u2019ve stolen the idea from someone else. I know that art is a constant dialogue and there are no new ideas under the sun, but there\u2019s a difference between responding to what came before you or coincidentally having the same idea and outright taking an idea out of someone\u2019s head. Probably not a problem that other artists have to deal with. ",
        "And even if it\u2019s not an idea that another artist has, am I allowed to use the things I see and hear in people\u2019s thoughts? It\u2019s one thing to know Frank\u2019s thoughts and see his paintings and help him do it - I have his permission. We\u2019re working together. If I just pass someone on the street and their thought inspires me in some way...isn\u2019t that just the same as being inspired by your environment? Artists pull from real life all the time - just because my environment is a little different from most doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m restricted, right? Or is it a violation? I don\u2019t know. ",
        "I\u2019ve tried talking to Dr. Bright about this, but she says she doesn\u2019t know enough about artistic creation to give sound advice. I still want to talk about it with her in person though - even if she feels she\u2019s not qualified to give artistic advice, I bet she still has an opinion. ",

I still have days when everyone\u2019s thoughts are so loud that I have to turn off all the lights in my dorm and crawl under the covers and listen to Jose Gonzalez and not come out for hours.

I know you were stressed at first but it didn\u2019t take you that long to get comfortable. And yeah, my mom is really easy to get along with and I know you and Frank can relate to each other - I really think it would be good for you to spend more time together. I mean, I can see his thoughts but that\u2019s different from actually experiencing combat first hand. And I know World War I and Iraq are pretty different wars, but I think you could understand him better than me when it comes to that stuff. And he doesn\u2019t have a lot of people to talk to - the venn diagram of people who have been in wars and people who know about atypicals does not overlap much. He\u2019s out job hunting right now but I can text him to see if he\u2019d want to come by when he\u2019s done? Oh no, sorry, that\u2019s too much I guess right?

I can\u2019t bring anyone with me, I can\u2019t take pictures or record - trust me, I\u2019ve tried - I can\u2019t share my ability.

        "Mark: Do you think I\u2019m a complete idiot? I know I\u2019ve been a bit slow - I mean, I have been recovering from two years spent horizontal and unconscious - but I haven\u2019t completely lost my ability for critical thinking. ",
        "Damien: Mark-",
        "Mark: Dr. Bright is my sister. My sister, your therapist, and Sam\u2019s doctor are all the same person. And it makes sense, Joan would have changed her name after leaving The AM- ",
        "Damien: Actually, Dr. Bright was the name The AM gave her. I was surprised you didn\u2019t remember that from when she got fired. ",
        "Mark: They never referred to her by name. Just \u201cthat doctor\u201d. Most of what I heard about it was from Charlie and I think he was kind of afraid to talk about her directly. As if they had some sort of alarm system that would go off if you said her name out loud-",
        "Damien: Well, you never know-",
        "Mark: How do you know that\u2019s her AM name anyway? Is that another thing you dragged out of her? Did you make her talk about The AM like you\u2019ve made me?",
        "Damien: Mark, just-",
        "Mark: Jesus, for once in your life, shut up. And stop wanting me to not be mad at you. You\u2019re not powerful enough to make that happen. ",
        "Damien: Fuck you. ",
        "Mark: Oh my god, why do you insist on being such a dick! What was the plan, Damien? Did you really think I wasn\u2019t going to find out?",
        "Damien: Yeah, how did you find out?",
        "Mark: Well, like I said, I\u2019m not an idiot, I guessed it a while ago, and oh, whoops, you also left your phone here and you\u2019ve got appointments with Dr. Bright in your fucking iCal. ",
        "Damien: You looked through my phone?",
        "Mark: Do you really think you can be indignant about this?",
        "Damien: It\u2019s password protected!",
        "Mark: Oh my god, we\u2019ve been sharing a room for three months, I\u2019ve been able to divine your iPhone password. You also seem to have my sister\u2019s office, cell, and home number, which I know she would never give out to a patient- ",
        "Damien: Please, please, tell me you didn\u2019t call-",
        "Mark: Of course I fucking called, Damien. I would have kept calling if you hadn\u2019t come back. ",
        "Damien: What did she say?",
        "Mark: Lucky for you, I got her machine - on which, by the way, she calls herself \u201cDr. Bright\u201d, so I guess you've only got her work cell, which is a small mercy. And yep, thanks to you, the first contact I\u2019ve had with my sister in four and a half years is leaving a fucking voicemail for her. ",
        "Damien: What did you tell her?",
        "Mark: Nope, you don\u2019t get to know that. You\u2019ve lost your sharing privileges. ",
        "Damien: Mark-",
        "Mark: Stop it! Stop using your ability on me, you absolute- (groans) I told her the truth. I told her that I\u2019m with you and I\u2019m safe and I would have told her where we are if I hadn\u2019t slept through the last part of the drive and had any fucking clue, and that I missed her and I know that she was the one who saved me, along with Sam-",
        "Damien: No, I saved you. I\u2019m the one that risked my life walking into that place and I\u2019m the one that carried you out-",
        "Mark: Risked your life? Damien, you\u2019ve never risked anything. You stay in your little world where you get everything you want and you never have to worry about anyone else-",
        "Damien: I worry about you. You could be part of that world, I\u2019ve been trying to get you to-",
        "Mark: You\u2019ve been trying to get me to be your minion, your sidekick. If you actually wanted a friend - an equal - in this, you would fucking tell me the truth about things.",

        "Damien: Then leave! You don\u2019t want my help? Fine. ",
        "Mark: I can\u2019t leave, Damien, because you want me to stay. ",
        "Damien: You know what, Mark, no I don\u2019t. You want to go running to your big sister, you be my guest. ",

        "Damien: It works how I say it works-",
        "Mark: You have to mean it! What do you want from me? Why do you want me to stay so badly?",
        "Damien: If I hadn\u2019t lied to you - if I\u2019d told you upfront that your sister roped me into to helping you escape and I...deviated from the plan, what would you have done?",
        "Mark: Deviated from the plan? That\u2019s fucking rich. You kidnapped me. ",
        "Damien: What would you have done?",
        "Mark: Well, probably nothing. I mean, I was really weak and I can\u2019t resist your ability even now so...I guess I\u2019d still be here. ",
        "Damien: Exactly. So what would have been the point in telling you the truth? Huh? It would have just upset you. ",
        "Mark: Did you ever consider just, I don\u2019t know, not kidnapping me?",
        "Damien: I needed to see how your ability worked. Dr. Bright would have never let me anywhere near you if I\u2019d handed you over. ",
        "Mark: Handed me over? God, I\u2019m not an asset for you to trade. You sound just like them. ",
        "Damien: Who? The AM? Yeah, I\u2019m nothing like them. I don\u2019t want to experiment on you - I want you to use your power however you want! ",
        "Mark: Which is usually however you want! Oh my god, your lack of self awareness is on a new level. ",
        "Damien: I can\u2019t change who I am. ",
        "Mark: But you can change how you behave. Don\u2019t you get it, Damien? Your power isn\u2019t a blanket excuse. It\u2019s an enabler. You don\u2019t have to lie, you don\u2019t have to manipulate - you choose to use your power this way. But you could use it differently - you could choose to be better.",
        "Damien: Why would I? You think that I need to not use my power as much, that I need to start treating everybody like they\u2019re worth something? What does that get me? Not all of us can be lovable boy scouts, Mark. Not all of us want to be. ",
        "Mark: You don\u2019t have to behave like such a sociopath. ",
        "Damien: Boy, you and Dr. B really are related. Both narrow minded, sanctimonious- ",
        "Mark: I\u2019m just looking for a little decency in you, Damien. Forgive me for actually trying to like you. I know nobody\u2019s ever made the attempt before. ",
        "Damien: So why bother?",
        "Mark: Because I\u2019m stuck with you. You want a Robin to your Batman or however the fuck you\u2019re thinking about it and so here I am. I\u2019m not going anywhere, apparently, unless you want me to, so I\u2019m trying to make this bearable for myself. ",
        "Damien: I thought we were having an okay time. We\u2019ve been, you know, bonding. ",
        "Mark: Is that what you think we\u2019ve doing? I\u2019ve been detailing every atypical ability I\u2019ve ever encountered over greasy take-out. ",
        "Damien: That\u2019s not bonding to you?",
        "Mark: I\u2019m more than my ability, Damien. I have other interests. ",
        "Damien: Okay. Okay, fine, we can talk about your other interests. Jesus, I didn\u2019t realize there was a manual on how to be Mark Bryant\u2019s friend...",
        "Mark: Do you even remember what I asked for two and a half months ago? One of the only requests I\u2019ve ever made. I asked if you could get me a camera. So that I could keep myself entertained during the day and take pictures when I go walking around at night. But you didn\u2019t want to have your picture taken. Which, of course, I never said I was going to do. But because there was the slightest possibility of inconvenience for you, you didn\u2019t do it. I know you haven\u2019t had a lot of people in your life, Damien, but you\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re smart. Figure out how to be a fucking human being. ",
        "Damien: Robert. ",

        "Mark: Okay. ",
        "Damien: So? Is that...are we good?",
        "Mark: Are we good? No, we're not good- because you shared a tiny sliver of basic personal information? No, Damien, we\u2019re not good. God, you\u2019re unbelievable. It\u2019s not that simple.",
        "Damien: What do you want me to do?",
        "Mark: I want you to have not kidnapped me and screwed over my sister and tried to make me think I fell for an imaginary woman and then lied about all of it. Can you do anything about that?",
        "Damien: To be fair, you also thought that Sam was imaginary for a bit and I genuinely know nothing about her so I don\u2019t think you can really put that one on me. ",
        "Mark: Oh my god, I am so sick of people lying to me and fucking gas-lighting me - you can\u2019t just worm your way out of the truth whenever you want. Jeez, this is exactly like The AM- Director Wadsworth was always trying to convince me of things that weren\u2019t true. When I was resistant, she would tell me that if I didn\u2019t exercise my power, it would rot me from the inside out,",

But you\u2019re being really honest with me with minimal snark, which is something I\u2019ve been desperately wanting...so...also I can feel it. Your power. You were right, this is...unique.

Sometimes when I would flex my ability around telepaths, I would just end up yanking out their thoughts and then sort of shouting into their heads?

        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m...not sure. It\u2019s never been a subject he\u2019s spoken about with me - his sexuality, that is. But...but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d go there. Not intentionally. ",
        "Sam: I\u2019m gonna kill him. ",
        "Chloe: Sam-",
        "Sam: If he- I mean- if he hurt Mark at all, I will kill him. Mark is vulnerable and we don\u2019t know how his ability interacts with Damien\u2019s but we do know Damien can\u2019t be trusted and- and oh my god, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really hated anyone before. Is that what this is? Is this real hate?",
        "Chloe: Okay, let\u2019s all take a deep breath. I doubt Damien has hurt Mark - that would sort of defeat the purpose of taking him in the first place, right? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe\u2019s right. We can\u2019t go flying off the handle. Not until we have more information at least. ",
        "Sam: Sorry. I just- I can\u2019t stand the idea of Mark being afraid of someone.  Thanks, Chloe. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe - I appreciate you accompanying Sam this morning but you are still my patient. You really shouldn\u2019t be here. ",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m not going anywhere. I want to help you and Sam figure this out. Oh my god, also, I almost completely forgot in all the chaos!",

        "Dr. Bright: What? What do you mean?",
        "Chloe: Shhh just everyone- be quiet for a second. Sorry, you were both confused all at once and my brain got kind of scrambled there for a sec. Adam\u2019s aunt Annabelle is Ellie Wadsworth. She\u2019s the same woman. ",
        "Sam: Wait, Wadsworth, as in-?",
        "Chloe: Yep. ",
        "Sam: How-?",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you certain? How do you know?",
        "Chloe: I\u2019m certain. I saw her in his thoughts yesterday and it took me a bit, but then I realized that it\u2019s the same woman you picture when you think about Wadsworth. Yeah, you\u2019re picturing her right now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How-",
        "Sam: Do you think that\u2019s how Adam\u2019s parents ended up working with The AM? Because of his aunt?",
        "Chloe: Probably? I mean, that would make sense. ",
        "Sam: Do you think Adam knows?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t think so. I mean, he didn\u2019t even really know what his parents did until I told him. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Of course. What\u2019s wrong?",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s Adam. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What about him? ",
        "Caleb: He\u2019s invited me over to his house to hang out tonight. ",
        "Dr. Bright: His house? He\u2019s at his house this weekend?",
        "Caleb: Yeah...where else would he be?",
        "Dr. Bright: I- I thought I remembered you mentioning he was with- um, with relatives this weekend. ",
        "Caleb: Did I? Oh. Well, yeah, he was staying with his aunt but she got pulled into work and so he\u2019s going back to his house. ",
        "Dr. Bright: She got called into work? What does his aunt do again? ",

        "Dr. Bright: I thought everything was squared away with you two. ",
        "Caleb: It is, it is - things are going well, like, really well. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then what\u2019s your concern?",
        "Caleb: Well, we\u2019ve only be back together for like, a week, but we missed each other so much that I feel like things have...escalated. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Oh! Oh.",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you know, like we\u2019ve spent basically every moment together in the past week and, I mean, most of the time we\u2019re just studying and stuff and we\u2019re at my house and my parents are home so it\u2019s - I mean, nothing\u2019s...happened. And like, nothing really happened when we were together before. I mean- well- not nothing, but like- it wasn\u2019t- ugh.",
        "Dr. Bright: You were taking it slow. ",
        "Caleb: Right, yeah, exactly. But now that things are good between us again and we don\u2019t have any secrets from each other, things are...",
        "Dr. Bright: Escalating. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you feel about that?",
        "Caleb: Good. I mean - yeah- like- I want to- well, you know, I mean, I feel- ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, take a deep breath. If you\u2019re not ready to get more physical with Adam, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d understand. ",
        "Caleb: No, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s really not that. It\u2019s that- well, he wants it too, you know? So when we\u2019re like...you know...it\u2019s just- it\u2019s really intense. Because I want stuff and he wants stuff and so it all kinda just- it\u2019s really overwhelming. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah. Yes, I see how that might be challenging. ",
        "Caleb: And I mean, it\u2019s sort of amazing too, because- well- I can feel what he\u2019s feeling and that\u2019s really nice \u2018cause it\u2019s like we have this awesome mind meld going on but it\u2019s more than that and I just want to able to enjoy it but he keeps getting nervous and then I get nervous and that sort of...well, it all sorta kills the mood, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you know why he\u2019s nervous?",
        "Caleb: I dunno. I guess because he\u2019s never really had a boyfriend before? I mean, neither have I - we\u2019re both new to this. And our relationship's been so fucking weird. Like, I feel like we\u2019ve gone about things in the wrong order: like, I told him my biggest secret and then we became boyfriends and then his parents became a problem but like, not for the normal reasons? And now we\u2019re getting into the, you know, the typical beginning-of-relationship stuff except we\u2019ve been together for like, six months and already said \u201cI love you\u201d and it\u2019s just. None of this is normal. ",
        "Dr. Bright: There\u2019s no guidebook to having your first relationship, Caleb. Or any of kind relationship, for that matter. You and Adam: may face unique challenges but it\u2019s not abnormal to be nervous about moving forward in a relationship. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, what\u2019s your real concern?",
        "Caleb: What if...what if I suck? Like...what if it doesn\u2019t live up to the hype?",
        "Dr. Bright: The hype?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you know - like, because we\u2019ve been taking it slow and everything\u2019s been so intense, there\u2019s been all this build up and- and-...what if he\u2019s disappointed? I\u2019ll know. Like, right away. There\u2019s no way he could hide that from me and I\u2019m just...I\u2019m scared, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Just talk to him. Express your concerns before...escalating things. ",

        "Caleb: No, no, I don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m not totally sure I can do that anymore actually - I mean, obviously I could but...well, things get...you know...and if we finally have the place to ourselves...well. You don\u2019t need the details.",
        "Dr. Bright: You know you can talk to me about anything, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I just think this conversation has been awkward enough already. I just...sometimes I want to be able to enjoy things like a normal person, you know? Yeah, getting to feel Adam\u2019s feelings is really nice sometimes but it\u2019s easy to get really caught up in it and it makes me feel...like...out of control. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve felt like that before, haven\u2019t you?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I have, but it\u2019s always been because someone was angry. Not...this. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Just remember all the mindfulness you\u2019ve been practicing for the past year. You\u2019re able to balance your emotions so well now, especially with Adam. I\u2019m sure that becomes difficult when things get...heated, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something wrong. Just be mindful and give yourself time to adjust. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right. Thanks, Dr. Bright. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is there anything else you want to discuss?",
        "Caleb: Nah - I\u2019ll see you tomorrow for our session anyway. I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have bothered you on your day off - I just kinda freaked. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You can call me anytime, Caleb, you know that. About anything. ",
        "Caleb: Thanks. It...it helped. Just even talking through it out loud to someone...there\u2019s not a lot of people I can talk to about this. Normally, I\u2019d talk to Adam about my ability and stuff, but I mean, this time obviously I couldn\u2019t. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you trust him?",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: Adam. Do you trust him to listen to you and respect your opinions and your feelings?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, of course I do. I mean, I trust him more than anybody in the world. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay, then you should talk to him about it, even if it is about him. After all, you did say he was nervous too - maybe he has similar fears.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll talk to him tonight.",

        "Dr. Bright: What? Oh. Um, yes, he\u2019s fine. You shouldn\u2019t be listening in on my thoughts when I\u2019m thinking about other patients. Even if you know them.",
        "Chloe: Oh yeah, that. He was worrying about the same thing yesterday when we saw him. ",

        "Sam: Is it about Adam\u2019s parents again? Does Caleb know about Annabelle?",
        "Chloe: No, no, it\u2019s definitely not that. It\u2019s about dating. Well, not dating necessarily- about what people who are dating sometimes do...you know, what you want to do with Mark and what I don\u2019t want to do with anyone?",
        "Sam: What? Oh. Oh. Chloe! ",
        "Dr. Bright: I agree with Sam on this - I\u2019m Mark\u2019s big sister, remember? I don\u2019t need to hear about his sex life. ",

        "Sam: Shut up. ",
        "Dr. Bright: We should not be discussing this. Caleb is already more involved in everything than he should be. He is my patient, I\u2019m supposed to keep him safe- that is, I\u2019m supposed to keep his information confidential, which I realize is impossible around you, Chloe-",
        "Chloe: That\u2019s not exactly true. ",

        "Chloe: Come on, Dr. Bright, I hear the way you think about him. And I understand, I do, you thought you lost your brother forever and then this sweet kid comes around who reminds you of Mark when he was a teenager-",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe-",
        "Chloe: And Caleb is so easy to love - I get it - we both do, right Sam? All of us want to protect him-",
        "Dr. Bright: Which is all the more reason we shouldn\u2019t be talking about him. I would appreciate it if you-",
        "Chloe: Just because you failed to protect Mark, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll fail to protect Caleb. It\u2019s not the same situation. ",
        "Sam: Chloe-",
        "Dr. Bright: But it is becoming dangerously close. The AM has destroyed people\u2019s lives-",
        "Chloe: Caleb hasn\u2019t been to The AM, you said yourself they don\u2019t care about him one way or the other. And besides, you worked there for years with seemingly no problem - not all of it can be that bad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That place is poison.",
        "Chloe: You don\u2019t believe that. It\u2019s not all evil but it poisoned you - that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yeah, yes, thank you, Chloe, I don\u2019t need a reminder that I have no privacy around you. ",
        "Chloe: Because you care so much about privacy, right? Which is why you record all of your patients without their consent? What, did you think I\u2019d let that go? I just. I know your intentions are good. I know you just want the recordings for research and I trust you, Dr. Bright, because I can hear your thoughts so stop pretending like it\u2019s crossing some line that I listen because it\u2019s the only reason I keep coming back.

        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t think you get to decide for others what is and isn\u2019t crossing the line. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I do what I need to - recordings are valuable evidence. ",
        "Chloe: For what?",
        "Dr. Bright: So I can understand atypicals better - I can\u2019t help my patients if I don\u2019t understand their conditions. Sam knows - she understands the importance of collecting research. ",
        "Sam: Yes, I do, but...I\u2019m sort of with Chloe on this one. I was really mad when I found out you were recording my sessions - if I remember correctly, I asked you to delete all of them.",
        "Dr. Bright: And I did - off my computer. You have the only copies. They could still be of some use to you.",
        "Sam: That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m happy that they exist in the first place. I never agreed to it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The people you\u2019re researching in the past don\u2019t agree to it either - they don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re there. ",
        "Sam: Yeah, but they\u2019re long dead! ",
        "Dr. Bright: And that makes it okay?",
        "Sam: I didn\u2019t choose this ability and neither did Chloe. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right. But you\u2019ve both gained a lot of control over your abilities and you now get to choose what to do with them. ",

        "Chloe: I mean, I\u2019m lucky - I have a mom who understands all this stuff. But it\u2019s not like she knows other mind readers...you\u2019ve been able to help in a way she can\u2019t. And I know you\u2019ve helped Caleb.",
        "Dr. Bright: He\u2019s just so young.",

        "Dr. Bright: And all he wants to do is go to school and play football and love his boyfriend who has a potentially dangerous family.  ",
        "Sam: Do we tell him? About Adam\u2019s aunt?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think it\u2019s up to Chloe. It\u2019s because of her ability that we know about Ellie- Annabelle at all. She should be the one to decide. ",
        "Chloe: How is that fair? I get yelled at for invading people\u2019s privacy and then I have to decide whether to share someone\u2019s secret without their consent?",
        "Dr. Bright: I thought you said you wanted to protect Caleb-",
        "Chloe: I do! But maybe ignorance is bliss in this case. If neither he or Adam know that Annabelle works for The AM, maybe they\u2019re already safe from her. And they just made things right- I don\u2019t want to ruin things for them!",
        "Sam: Chloe-",
        "Chloe: No, stop, I can hear what you\u2019re both thinking- I\u2019m not overreacting, I\u2019m just sick and tired of being blamed for knowing things I can\u2019t help knowing. Either let me use my ability as I want or stop using my brain as your own personal wire tap. ",

        "Sam: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe and I haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye. I\u2019m sorry for dragging you into it. Privacy has been an issue between Chloe and I for some time and I- I should have worked on resolving it long ago. ",
        "Sam: It\u2019s okay. As you said - I\u2019m one to talk. I\u2019ve violated people\u2019s privacy too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019re right - it is different when you\u2019re observing people in the past. ",
        "Sam: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What-",
        "Sam: What did you mean before?",
        "Dr. Bright: When?",
        "Sam: Before Caleb called. You said you never intended for any of this to happen. ",
        "Dr. Bright: When I set up my private practice I knew there would be some...complications. ",
        "Sam: Because you were still under The AM\u2019s thumb. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Exactly. I wasn't sure I could truly help people with The AM always looking over my shoulder but I didn\u2019t really have a choice. It was either continue to feed them information and try to get my brother out or try to report them - take them down - and who knows what that would have led to. It could have very quickly and spectacularly backfired. So I chose the easier option - the safer option, the selfish option. And I thought I could make the most of it - continue the good work that I was doing and find a way to get Mark out of there. And now three of my patients are tied up in this horrible situation and I- well, I never intended that to happen. ",
        "Sam: Maybe that was true when you first started but you wanted to recruit me and Chloe the moment we walked into your office. I mean, you asked Chloe point blank to eavesdrop on your ex while you met with him. And me-",
        "Dr. Bright: I told you about Mark because you saw him-",
        "Sam: But how long would have been until you asked? Even if I hadn\u2019t come across him on my own, I was always your ticket to getting him out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: My goodness, this is really the day for confronting all my faults, isn\u2019t it?",
        "Sam: No, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not trying to pile on but- I just. You\u2019ve talked a lot to me about acceptance. It\u2019s worth owning up to some of your mistakes, don\u2019t you think?",
        "Dr. Bright: Speaking of, should I interpret what you said earlier as you spying on people who are not only in the past?",
        "Sam: We\u2019re not talking about me-",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, have you done something that could get you into trouble?",

        "Dr. Bright: I know. But you\u2019re right. Both of you are. I did view you both as...tools when we first met.",
        "Sam: I thought you said relationships aren\u2019t based on someone\u2019s usefulness to you.",
        "Dr. Bright: Ideally, that\u2019s true. But that\u2019s not how- well, I learned quite the opposite at The AM. My relationships there...",
        "Sam: Don\u2019t tell me you were with Agent Green because he was useful. He seems...well- not un-useful but-",
        "Dr. Bright: No, being with Owen wasn\u2019t about that. I liked his company. No, it was- well. Wadsworth only associates herself with people who have something to offer her. ",
        "Sam: What kind of aunt do you think she is? I mean, I can\u2019t imagine she has much to gain from her relationship with her 17 year old nephew. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I have no idea. ",
        "Sam: Are you okay? Sorry- insane question, I just- when Chloe told us about Annabelle, you went really, really pale. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I, uh- there was actually a part of me that thought - just for a moment - that Ellie was Adam\u2019s aunt because of me. That it was all part of an elaborate scheme to insert herself back into my life. ",
        "Sam: Wow. She\u2019s really in your head isn\u2019t she?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. I suppose she is. ",
        "Sam: How have your meetings with her been going?",
        "Dr. Bright: They\u2019ve been...fine. ",
        "Sam: What do you guys talk about?",
        "Dr. Bright: The work, mostly. Innovations in the field, new discoveries, et ceterca. (beat) Occasionally she\u2019ll ask me personal questions. Especially if she thinks it will help her get under my skin. But we were never- we weren\u2019t really close friends in that way. ",
        "Sam: As in, you didn\u2019t talk about your feelings and stuff?",
        "Dr. Bright: Right. ",
        "Sam: A bit ironic for two therapists don\u2019t you think?",
        "Dr. Bright: Ellie isn\u2019t a therapist really. Her degrees are in neuroscience. She worked with the patients, yes, but she was usually coming at it from a hard science angle. ",
        "Sam: Not a people person?",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s - she was good at talking to the patients sometimes, at talking them down from a crisis or talking them into something. But it was only if it benefitted her. I don\u2019t think she cared much about what benefitted the patient. She was extremely emotionally manipulative. ",
        "Sam: Hm. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Sam: Nothing. I- it just sounds like maybe she rubbed off on you. What? I\u2019m not trying to kick you while you\u2019re down, but- I mean-",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s fine, Sam. know I\u2019m not the paragon of virtue. ",
        "Sam: You and me both. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sam, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. The mistakes you\u2019ve made have been out of your control.",
        "Sam: But why didn\u2019t I keep looking?",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Sam: Why did I come home? I haven\u2019t even been back two weeks and Mark\u2019s contacted us. I should have stayed out there. I should have kept looking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: We don\u2019t have any better idea of where he is now than we did two weeks ago. Continuing your search probably wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. ",
        "Sam: But I gave up. I gave up on him and he would never have given up on me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You didn\u2019t give up. You made a tactical retreat to regroup. ",
        "Sam: Oh boy, you really have been spending too much time at The AM. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think you\u2019re probably right. ",
        "Sam: Once we get Mark back will you- will you be able to- you know-",
        "Dr. Bright: Will I be able to what?",
        "Sam: To tell Wadsworth and The AM to go fuck themselves?",
        "Dr. Bright: Samantha!",
        "Sam: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m very stressed out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know. ",
        "Sam: Your reluctance is not super encouraging. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I- I don\u2019t want stir things up the moment things come together. I\u2019ll wait for Mark to settle in. Keep an eye on both him and The AM until things calm down. ",
        "Sam: Just admit it, Joan. You like going there. You like talking to her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I guess I do. Or at least, parts of it. I don\u2019t like physically going to The AM - that place holds too many memories. All of which have been tainted by the image of my brother sick and scared behind a glass door. ",
        "Sam: But...?",
        "Dr. Bright: But talking to Wadsworth is...well, it\u2019s easy to get sucked back into it. She\u2019s so clever. And powerful. I remember, a few months before I...left, we got a visit from headquarters - all these gray haired men in suits coming to evaluate the branch and get an update on a project we were doing - Wadsworth\u2019s pet project. It- Oh, who cares, you\u2019ve already hacked them: it had to do with making non-atypicals immune to atypicals. ",
        "Sam: What? Is that- is that possible?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. Well, at least not yet. That\u2019s what Wadsworth would always say: \u201cwhat\u2019s impossible today is yesterday\u2019s news tomorrow\u201d. ",
        "Sam: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: Exactly. Pretty meaningless but she said it with such conviction that you believed anything really was possible. Ellie doesn\u2019t believe in dead ends. And so these higher-ups came, all ready to shut down this experimental program that was costing millions of dollars and yielding no results, and Ellie got up in front of the entire conference room and essentially bullied headquarters into giving her twenty million more dollars and extending the trial by two years. By the time the brass left, they looked like they had been on a tilt-a-whirl. ",
        "Sam: Wow. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. She is something else. ",
        "Sam: You don\u2019t have to say it with quite so much admiration. ",

        "Mark: I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s- he\u2019s doing whatever I want when I\u2019m around him. I think his power rebounded off of mine and he\u2019s- he\u2019s really weird. He\u2019s not himself. ",

I\u2019ll do what I need to for gas and stuff- I think Damien might have a bank account. I\u2019ll be home soon. Give me a week. I\u2019ll get there. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Frank- do you mind if I record this? It won\u2019t be heard by anyone but me, but I find it helpful to listen back to sessions in order to understand my patients better. ",
        "Frank: Like Chloe does when she\u2019s talking to people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Exactly.  ",
        "Frank: She\u2019s the reason you\u2019re asking, isn\u2019t she?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Frank: She told me about the argument the two of you had. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. ",
        "Frank: She feels pretty bad about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: She shouldn\u2019t. Did she tell you she felt bad or was it something you felt?",
        "Frank: I felt it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you feel about being able to do that? About being able to feel other people\u2019s emotions?",
        "Frank: It depends. ",
        "Dr. Bright: On what?",
        "Frank: On who the person is. I- I like feeling what Chloe feels. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And everyone else?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t like how anxious you feel right now. I hope I\u2019m not making you nervous. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I- no, of course not, Frank. It\u2019s been- it\u2019s been a stressful few days that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sorry if my anxiety is making you anxious. You have nothing to worry about when you\u2019re in here. ",
        "Frank: Thank you. And thank you for agreeing to see me again. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course, Frank. I want to help. I\u2019d like to start by talking about what your goals are for therapy - what do you feel was missing in your sessions at the VA?",
        "Frank: Well, like I said the last time, they couldn\u2019t really understand everything that I\u2019d gone through. I suppose I could\u2019ve told them about the experiments but...well, I didn\u2019t want anything to get back to the higher ups. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why is that?",
        "Frank: There are things that they don\u2019t know about me - things that they overlooked when I was discharged. I didn\u2019t want to give them any reason to get suspicious and track me down again. They\u2019ve left me alone so far. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You haven\u2019t had much contact with the military since returning home?",
        "Frank: No, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Remember, Frank, you don\u2019t have to call me ma\u2019am, unless you want to. You\u2019re welcome to call me Dr. Bright, or Joan, if you prefer. What didn\u2019t you want them knowing?",
        "Frank: That I was having problems with the Unity compound. They didn\u2019t- they assumed it wouldn\u2019t work anymore. That\u2019s why they haven\u2019t been very involved. They don\u2019t realize I can still use the empath ability. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was the compound - you said it was called the Unity compound?",
        "Frank: That\u2019s what we called it. It had a long, official name - a bunch of letters and numbers that the lab coats called it - but we called it Unity because that was the name of the Project. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. And was Unity meant to be temporary?",
        "Frank: No, it was permanent. But it was only supposed to work with the other people who got it - just the rest of my unit. It wasn\u2019t supposed to work with everyone.",
        "Dr. Bright: Do they know that it can work with anyone?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t believe so, no. You\u2019re confused. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s just- that\u2019s a pretty significant detail for a team of scientists to overlook. ",
        "Frank: The scientists didn\u2019t. When they put the Unity compound - drug, serum, or whatever it was - into us, that was monitored. We did all these tests and trials, did exercises as a unit to get used to it, had all our vitals measured the whole time to make sure our bodies could take the stress. But once they realized it worked, we were put back in the field and they stopped checking up so much. We would go back to the base and do evals in between our tours but it\u2019s not like they knew what to look for. Once it was in our bodies it wasn\u2019t supposed to change.",
        "Dr. Bright: But it did change?",
        "Frank: Yes. We were all a bit slow to notice at first - it\u2019s an adjustment, being that in tune with eight other people. But eventually your body settles into it, finds a rhythm - a comfort - in it. Towards the end of our second tour, we noticed that something had shifted. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Shifted how?",
        "Frank: Have you ever painted with watercolors, Dr. Bright?",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t say that I have. ",
        "Frank: It\u2019s not my preferred medium - with oils and acrylics, you can be more exact. It\u2019s easier to get the color you want, make the lines that you want - and you can always paint over it once it\u2019s dry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And that\u2019s not the case with watercolor?",
        "Frank: If you\u2019re not careful, watercolor bleeds. The pigment will stray outside the line, spread out on it\u2019s own. And you can\u2019t pull it back in or paint over it - if you add more paint, it bleeds more. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds frustrating. ",
        "Frank: It can be. But the end result is beautiful if you have the patience for it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure it is. ",
        "Frank: That started happening to us. For the first year or so, the Unity stayed within the lines of our unit - it was contained to the nine of us. It was painting with oils - each person was their own color, but you could mix them in different combinations. But it was deliberate; it was in our control. And then...",
        "Dr. Bright: And then?",
        "Frank: It started to bleed. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean by that, Frank?",
        "Frank: I\u2019d like to talk about something else, please. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright. We can come back to this. Is it alright if I ask you a few questions about the experiments?",
        "Frank: Okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Was it just your unit being given the chemical compound, or were they testing it on multiple units?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t know. We were the only marines I ever saw around - I mean, I guess they could have been doing more experiments elsewhere in the country but we were the first team as I understand it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you don\u2019t know if more soldiers were given the compound?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t know of any specifically but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they tried it out on some other people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Frank: The experiment was a success in their eyes - at least that was the impression we got after our first tour. It did make us more efficient - more cohesive as a unit. I think they\u2019ve shut down the project now though. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you know?",
        "Frank: It was expensive. With each check-up, fewer and fewer people were involved. At the last eval we had, there were only...ten people there? Maybe?",
        "Dr. Bright: And previously there had been more?",
        "Frank: Lots more. The initial trials had about twenty doctors, at least five generals, and then a bunch of brass from the DOD and that AM organization. There were probably about fifty people there watching us as we got injected for the first time. ",
        "Dr. Bright: My goodness. And you recognized the Hayes out of all that?",
        "Frank: Well, they were pretty high up as far as I can tell. It was pretty easy to pick out the people that were running different parts of the show. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And the Hayes were running part of it?",
        "Frank: It sure seemed like it. There was Dr. Roberts, Dr. Sadler, and Dr. Rodriguez - those were the folks actually injecting us, doing our physicals, basically running the people end of the experiment. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you had any contact with any of these doctors since returning?",
        "Frank: Not really. Dr. Sadler wrote me a nice letter after-  well, right before I came back. She was always really nice to us. So was Dr. Rodriguez, but he left the Project after our second tour. I never did find out why. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And Dr. Roberts?",
        "Frank: Haven\u2019t heard anything. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to these days - I imagine he\u2019d be retired by now, he was ancient. I guess he\u2019d been a field medic way back in the day and moved up the ranks with the General who was running the military side of the project. General Patton - yep, that\u2019s his real name. No relation, as far as I know. He and Dr. Roberts were pretty close - I think they came up with the idea for Unity together and then got the Hayes and The AM to make it a reality. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But the Hayes weren\u2019t the ones running the experiments?",
        "Frank: No. They were responsible for the compound itself. I guess they\u2019re some of the DOD\u2019s top scientists so they did all the nitty-gritty lab stuff. Worked with the Director from The AM that would come in from time to time. I never caught her name but I think she may have been related to Dr. Hayes- the female Dr. Hayes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What makes you say that?",
        "Frank: Well, they looked alike for one. And they had definitely known each other for a long time - you can tell that type of thing, you know? They were always whispering to each other, trying to give each other notes...before I joined up with Unity, I was with a larger unit of Marines and there were these twins. You could tell they loved each other - they would have died for each other - but they were also fiercely competitive. One was always trying to one-up the other. Dr. Hayes and this Director were like that - like sibling rivalry. Between that, the fact that the Hayes are a married couple, and that Patton and Roberts had known each other for a hundred years, it really felt like a family affair. Guess there\u2019s benefit to such closed ranks - easier to build trust and- why did you get scared all of a sudden?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Frank: There\u2019s this balloon of fear that just started expanding\u2014 is something wrong?",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I- I think I know The AM Director you\u2019re referring to. She keeps popping up in unexpected places. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, that doesn\u2019t surprise me. Like I said, I never talked to her, but she had a certain...something about her. Slippery or something. Slippery but strong. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That sounds about right.  It sounds like you got a very good handle on the scope and structure of the whole project. Did they brief you on each of these individuals before you began the experiments?",
        "Frank: No, ma\u2019- sorry. Hard habit to break, especially when talking about this kind of stuff. No. It was just things I picked up from being in the room. Most of the time, scientists and generals and all those types don\u2019t really pay attention to you when you\u2019re a soldier. They kind of forget you\u2019re there, I think. So they talk like they\u2019re alone. Makes it pretty easy to get the lay of the land.  ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said you liked Dr. Sadler and Dr. Rodriguez - how did you feel about the rest of the team?",
        "Frank: I didn\u2019t have as much contact with the rest of them - General Patton was a smart man, but very serious. Same with the Hayes - very smart and very stubborn. The military was trying to rush them but they wouldn\u2019t let the docs inject us until they were one hundred percent confident that the compound was safe. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds like...like you were in good hands. ",
        "Frank: We were. You\u2019re surprised again.",
        "Dr. Bright: You can feel that?",
        "Frank: No, I can see it on your face. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah. I\u2019m not surprised at the fact that the team working on Project Unity was the best of the best, but- well, I suppose I\u2019m a bit surprised to hear you talk about it so easily and in such positive terms. ",
        "Frank: It wasn\u2019t the scifi horror show that it might sound like. I get it, the term \u201cmilitary experiment\u201d is a bit...intense. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And it wasn\u2019t intense?",
        "Frank: Oh no, it was. But not that much more than anything else I did in my years with the Marines. It was a lot like regular training, but with more needles and monitors. But it\u2019s not like we were being tortured. We all volunteered. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you feel about it now? ",
        "Frank: About volunteering?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Frank: If I could go back, knowing what I know now, I would make the same choice. I\u2019ve surprised you again. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. You have. ",
        "Frank: It\u2019s not the volunteering I regret. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you do regret something?",
        "Frank: I regret a lot of things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Like what?",
        "Frank: I\u2019m- I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to talk about that just yet. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Let\u2019s leave the past for a moment - how are you feeling now? Today, this week - how are things going?",
        "Frank: Better. There are still- well, you know, there are still bad days. But going back to the counselor at the VA a few months ago really helped me deal with- with some of the more normal military stuff, I guess. Chloe has been a big help. It\u2019s nice to have someone who knows what\u2019s going on in my head without having to explain.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very glad to hear that. And Mrs. Turner? Are you happy living with her?",
        "Frank: Very much. I try to help around the house as much as I can - fixing things that don\u2019t need too steady of a hand but Vanessa...well, she doesn\u2019t need a lot of help, does she? I\u2019ll offer to carry something heavy for her but she just...",
        "Dr. Bright: Uses her mind?",
        "Frank: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty amazing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It is. I\u2019m sure she appreciates the offer of help all the same.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I think she does but I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome. Once I get a job, I\u2019ll start saving up so I can find my own spot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How are you feeling about the job search?",
        "Frank: Alright. Some people get weird about hiring vets. They either don\u2019t want to deal with the trouble of someone like me - someone who hasn\u2019t had a job since he left the military, who maybe they recognize from the streets - or they feel like they owe you something because you served. That\u2019s almost worse. They make you feel like you\u2019re special in a way that\u2019s...well, I already have plenty of reason to feel different, I don\u2019t need someone pointing it out by thanking me for my service or telling me how brave I am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know that it must be difficult being an even smaller niche of the military, but you are not alone in feeling this way. Last time we spoke, you mentioned you still went to meetings at the vet center from time to time - I think that\u2019s a wonderful idea. ",
        "Frank: Yeah, it\u2019s good. But even that- well, sometimes I don\u2019t want to relate to someone as a soldier, you know? It can be great to hear other vets talk but sometimes I just want to be me. Nothing else. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s perfectly understandable. I hope that\u2019s what this space can be for you - you can just be who you are, in this moment. I\u2019ll never ask you to be anyone else. ",
        "Frank: Thank you. That\u2019s why I was even willing to talk to Chloe all those months ago. She was so odd - she came out of nowhere and just started talking to me. A few words here and there until she mentioned painting and then it all just came pouring out. And I didn\u2019t get it then - how she knew I was an artist - but I was just so relieved to have somebody see me as something more than a homeless vet. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m very glad that the two of you met. I think it has been good for both of you. ",
        "Frank: I hope so - I hope that it\u2019s been good for Chloe, that is. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without her, or Vanessa. I actually have a job interview this afternoon that Vanessa set up for me - security at the university she works at. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful. ",
        "Frank: I hope it goes well. I think it\u2019d be perfect - it\u2019s a night shift covering the main library and a couple administrative buildings so it\u2019d be quiet and then I could paint during the day when the light is good. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It sounds ideal. Are you comfortable working alone?",
        "Frank: I think so. I\u2019ve been on my own for a little while now and it\u2019s...it\u2019s easier when I\u2019m having a bad spell if I\u2019m not around other people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand that. I\u2019m curious - do you feel a difference between being around Chloe and her mother versus non-atypicals?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t know. When I was on the street, sometimes there would be these rushes of emotions so strong that I felt like I was drowning. But I\u2019m not sure if it was from the people passing by or if it was just...",
        "Dr. Bright: Just what?",
        "Frank: It definitely feels stronger with people like Chloe and her mom - it feels more like it did with my unit. Like we\u2019re on the same wavelength. Being around Caleb is sort of the same except- well, he\u2019s a nice kid and all, but I can\u2019t say I enjoy being around him all that much. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why not?",
        "Frank: It\u2019s like...okay, so we had these walkie talkies we used over there - these relics - old, clunky tech. We didn\u2019t really need radios because of they way we could communicate but we carried them just in case. And sometimes when two walkie talkies were on and next to each other, there would be an awful screeching sound. Being around Caleb is like that- like our minds are trying to tune in to each other but we just keep getting feedback. I guess because he\u2019s a real empath.",
        "Dr. Bright: That makes sense to me - I\u2019ve heard a patient describe something similar before. ",
        "Frank: Let me guess - was it Caleb?",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t tell you that. ",
        "Frank: Right.",
        "Dr. Bright: Is there anyone else you have a strong reaction to?",
        "Frank: I guess it must be easier with atypicals because, yes, I can feel Sam\u2019s emotions sometimes. Not a lot of them but...it\u2019s like I can feel the ones I recognize, if that makes sense. With Chloe, it\u2019s the creative things that always feels the strongest - when she gets excited about something she\u2019s working on, it\u2019s like this little spark jumps into my body and I want to pick up a paintbrush right away. And I try but...well, I haven\u2019t gotten my hands to stop shaking for long enough to finish anything. But it\u2019s nice to watch Chloe paint. She\u2019s better than she gives herself credit for. I can feel her sadness too - she tries to hide it, but I know her well enough now to feel it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So your ability to \u201ctune in\u201d increases the more you spend time with someone?",
        "Frank: It seems to. With Sam though, I got a signal right away. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Because she was feeling an emotion you recognized?",
        "Frank: Yeah. That\u2019s right. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What was the emotion?",
        "Frank: Guilt. She\u2019s swallowed in it. A lot of people in my unit had stuff to feel guilty about - myself included - but...she wears it like a straightjacket, you know? I thought it was going to choke her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is guilt something you feel frequently?",
        "Frank: Around Sam? Yeah, a fair bit. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I meant yourself. Not other people\u2019s emotions - do you feel guilt yourself?",
        "Frank: Of course I do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Would you like to talk about it?",
        "Frank: I already know why I feel that way - it\u2019s not like it\u2019s unusual for someone like me. I feel guilty about the things that I did, the people I killed. About my unit. Survivor\u2019s guilt and all that. Standard stuff.",
        "Dr. Bright: Just because other people may feel the same things doesn\u2019t make your emotions any less valid or any less worth examining. ",
        "Frank: I\u2019ve talked about all this with the military counselor. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you don\u2019t feel that you need to talk about it more?",
        "Frank: Well, I- the thing is, that- well, I couldn\u2019t tell the counselor everything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why not?",
        "Frank: Because there are some things that happened that don't happen to every soldier. Maybe other people kill and lose people but no one- no one...",
        "Dr. Bright: No one what?",
        "Frank: No one else has to feel all of it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean, Frank?",
        "Frank: That\u2019s- that\u2019s how we noticed the difference. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What difference?",
        "Frank: The- the bleeding - the Unity working on people other than us. I- I don\u2019t know that I can- it\u2019s not pleasant to talk about.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve heard many things in this office, Frank. I- I\u2019ve done many things that I\u2019m not proud of. I\u2019m not going to judge you. But if you\u2019re not ready to talk about it, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m here whenever you\u2019re ready. There\u2019s no timeline for this. ",
        "Frank: No, I want to- there\u2019s so much that I haven\u2019t said since- and so much I\u2019ve never said- and Chloe doesn\u2019t even know. I mean, maybe she\u2019s picked up a thought here and there but I don\u2019t think she- I don\u2019t know that she\u2019d ever understand. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll be able to understand.",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t say with any confidence that I\u2019ll ever be able to understand what you\u2019ve been through, Frank. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to keep your experience to yourself. If you want to say it out loud, you can. ",
        "Frank: We- we went in for a raid. And there were- well, there were bad people, okay? And the intel was solid - these guys were the enemy - they were the enemy - they were holed up in this house in the middle of nowhere, totally alone, no civilians or anything like that. It was a clear-cut mission. And- and-",
        "Dr. Bright: Did something go wrong?",
        "Frank: No, no- not in the way you\u2019re thinking. It went off without a hitch - these guys were dangerous but by then, we were working together seamlessly. We\u2019d had the Unity for a year or so and it was like we were one person. So we go through this house - quiet as can be - and take the men out. And that\u2019s the first time we felt the bleed- the- there was something else seeping into our bodies. Someone else\u2019s emotions. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you find out where it was coming from?",
        "Frank: Yes. It wasn\u2019t one of ours it was- it was the men we killed. They- well, once the first shot rang out, they picked up their weapons and it was harder to get a clean shot in. So some of the men- the- they were our enemy. It was our job to- we had to- but we didn\u2019t know that it would- that we would- We felt them die. All of us - we felt these men lose their grip on life and take their final breaths. And it wasn\u2019t pain - not the pain that you see on someone\u2019s face when they die, not the pain that I- that I- it was something else. It was fear and disappointment and hate and sadness and I can taste it on my tongue even now and I\u2019m just- we\u2019re so sorry. We didn\u2019t know and then we felt it and it made things so hard and we- you have to get used to it, to do what we do and we knew it wasn\u2019t okay but we did it anyway. And we didn\u2019t tell anyone because we didn\u2019t want to leave- we just kept doing it, kept feeling it, every time because if we- if we left- if they shut us down, we wouldn\u2019t be together anymore and we had to be together, we had to stay together, we had to die together and we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Thank you for sharing this with me, Frank. I know this must be incredibly difficult for you but saying it out loud is an important step in accepting what happened. ",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t want to accept it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand that, Frank, and it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel that way. But you don\u2019t have to do penance for your past actions. ",
        "Frank: Of course I do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, Frank. Punishing yourself forever is not going to get you anywhere. It doesn\u2019t honor those men, or your unit, or the life you still need to live. ",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t deserve it. This life. I should have- I should have gone with them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course you deserve this life, Frank. Everyone deserves to live. Think about all the things you have in your life - art, Chloe, your own progress. Even without all of that, you have a heart beating in your chest and air in your lungs. You are alive. Despite everything you\u2019ve been through, you have survived. You are strong. You are strong enough to accept what you cannot change. I know you are. ",
        "Frank: How? How do you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Because you were strong enough to share what happened to you. That takes so much courage. ",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t feel courageous. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand that. But coming in here, talking about what has happened to you, that is an act of courage. We cannot change the past, Frank. As much as we may want to. All that\u2019s important now is what lies ahead. ",
        "Frank: How am I supposed to move forward from this? These feelings, they- they cycle through my body like poison working its way through my bloodstream. And I can\u2019t suck it out. No matter what I do, I\u2019m infected with it. The colors bleed and I can never get them back inside the lines again. I can\u2019t forget and sometimes I wish I could but that wouldn\u2019t be fair - I have to remember them. All of them. Everything that happened. I can\u2019t forget. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Frank, earlier you said you didn\u2019t regret volunteering. Why is that?",
        "Frank: They were my family. They were my family and I let them down. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It is extremely difficult to lose your family, Frank. It\u2019s okay to feel sad or angry or guilty about it - it\u2019s expected, even. But I\u2019d like you to tell me about why you volunteered in the first place. What made you want to join the Marines?",
        "Frank: Well, like I said, it was my dad\u2019s idea. And it seemed like the thing to do, to make him happy. But then...I like protecting people. I want people to be safe, for their lives to be better. And I thought the Marines was the way to do that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you feel about the Marines now?",
        "Frank: I don\u2019t know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Last session you said you were excited - honored - to be part of Project Unity. Why is that?",
        "Frank: I wanted to make a difference - to be part of something that could change the world. My nana was always going on about how scientists were the real heroes. She was married to a scientist - I never met him, but he helped make some breakthroughs in vaccines in the sixties and nana was always so proud of that. She didn\u2019t like that my dad went to war and she really didn\u2019t like that he wanted me to go. She would always say that wars come and go but science is always there. She liked the certainty of it. Project Unity felt like my chance to live up to her - to the man she wanted me to be. Unity was cutting edge, it- it changed things. What we did - it wasn\u2019t perfect, maybe, but it could help a lot of people. They know that it works now - making normal people better, stronger. That could save lives. It did save lives. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t regret. Progress is progress and I\u2019m happy to die for that if it means the folks who come after me get to live a better life. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Next time you start to remember the difficult moments in your past, focus on that - on the fact that you were part of something bigger that you feel was bettering humanity. Nothing that happened can change that fact. ",
        "Frank: Yes, ma\u2019am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you still need to try and accept the things you cannot change. Are you willing to try an exercise with me?",
        "Frank: Okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Make sure you\u2019re seated comfortably, close your eyes, and focus all of your attention on your breath...",
        "[sfx: ticking clock and deep breaths as time passes]",
        "Dr. Bright: ...now let the last leaf float away and begin to bring your attention back into the room. Whenever you\u2019re ready, open your eyes. How was that?",
        "Frank: It was...interesting. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever done anything like that before. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know it can feel a bit foreign at first, but any time you become overwhelmed, imagine your thoughts as leaves on a stream. Accept that they are there and let them float by. ",
        "Frank: Okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Alright, we\u2019re out of time for this week. ",

And besides, if it\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t do, then I know it\u2019s something I definitely shouldn\u2019t- wait, I think Sam is here. ",

I\u2019ve hated sitting here, for- for eight days - it\u2019s been eight days since he called and I just- I couldn\u2019t stand not doing anything so I tried to find Mark dimensionally. I mean, it didn\u2019t work any of the times I tried over the summer but then something today just finally clicked. And I found him. Them. ",
        "Dr. Bright: In the past?",
        "Sam: Yes. Right after he got out of The AM, I think. Because he still looked not great. And they were running promos for the Olympics so it must have still been July. And Damien- ",

        "Sam: Damien was totally- I mean, I know I wasn\u2019t completely truthful with Mark about everything but this was- he was trying to convince Mark that he was the one behind getting Mark out. That he was protecting Mark from his \u201cevil sister\u201d and- I mean, Mark wasn\u2019t sure how I fit into the picture and- well, I get that that\u2019s partly my fault, but Damien- he was making Mark believe that I didn\u2019t exist! Mark was uncertain to begin with, his head was so muddled from waking up I think and it was- it was like Damien was preying on it. Like- Joan, when you\u2019ve described how Wadsworth emotionally manipulates people? It was like that. And Mark was so - he was so confused and scared I could see him doubting himself and- and-",

        "Dr. Bright: Did you and Adam ever wonder how they got involved in the project?",
        "Caleb: Well they work for, like, a secret division of the Department of Defense, and isn\u2019t The AM a secret government agency? Seems like they would go together.",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you know they work for a secret division of the DOD?",
        "Caleb: We may have snooped around their home office last weekend. ",

        "Caleb: No embarrassing disasters, if that\u2019s what you mean. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, I wouldn\u2019t categorize it as a disaster. Movies and TV make physical relationships look effortless. It\u2019s not always like that in reality. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Are you still disappointed?",
        "Caleb: No, I\u2019m not- it\u2019s not that I was disappointed. I was just- well, I guess I\u2019d built everything up in my head too much. And it\u2019s not like we really...you know, went all that far but it\u2019s just- we weren\u2019t really in sync, you know? All the emotions got to be too much and I feel like I was too stressed out to actually focus on, I don\u2019t know, on being there I guess. Not that it was bad- I mean, we always have a good time together, no matter what we\u2019re doing but- ",

        "Dr. Bright: Adam\u2019s parents had a personal connection to The AM - that\u2019s how they got the contract. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, this Wadsworth person? Adam doesn\u2019t have any relatives named Wadsworth. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s a code name. I knew her as Ellie Wadsworth when I worked there but her full name is-",

        "Caleb: So Adam\u2019s aunt, what? Works for The AM?",
        "Dr. Bright: She runs it. Here, anyway. She\u2019s the regional director. ",
        "Caleb: Okay, but you worked for them, didn\u2019t you? And so did Adam\u2019s parents. And you\u2019re all, you know, good, not dangerous people. Annabelle seemed normal. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You met her?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, pretty briefly. She gave me a ride home last weekend when she picked up Adam. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What was your impression of her?",
        "Caleb: Um, fine, I guess. She seemed cool.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m curious, how did her feelings feel to you? You\u2019ve said in the past that Adam\u2019s parents\u2019 feelings are familiar because they have a similar quality to Adam\u2019s. Was it the same with Annabelle?",
        "Caleb: Um, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t really notice her feelings. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Did she- did she ask about you at all?",
        "Caleb: Not really. I mean, she asked us how our day was going and about school and stuff but nothing weird. Do you think she knows that I\u2019m an atypical?",
        "Dr. Bright: She does. She- she\u2019s asked me about you. ",
        "Caleb: Wait, you talk to her? ",
        "Dr. Bright: I do. We used to work together and we still have meetings from time to time. ",
        "Caleb: Did you know she was related to Adam?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. Not until very recently. Chloe figured it out. ",
        "Caleb: Right. Last week she said Annabelle looked familiar, we just thought it was because she\u2019d seen her in Adam\u2019s thoughts. ",
        "Dr. Bright: She had seen Annabelle in my thoughts as well. ",
        "Caleb: Okay, so you and Adam\u2019s aunt used to work together and you still hang out sometimes. What\u2019s the big deal?",
        "Dr. Bright: Well, it\u2019s possible Chloe recognized Annabelle from Frank\u2019s thoughts as well. She was involved in the experiments. ",
        "Caleb: But that makes sense if she\u2019s the one that got Adam\u2019s parents involved. And I know that Frank got all messed up from those but he\u2019s doing better now. I don\u2019t get why everyone is freaking out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Wadswor- Annabelle was the one who brought my brother to The AM. ",
        "Caleb: Wait, wasn\u2019t your brother, like, in captivity for years?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: At The AM.",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: And Annabelle what- kidnapped him?",
        "Dr. Bright: She specifically targeted him. It is my belief that she was surveilling me and found out about Mark\u2019s ability and lured him into The AM. And she\u2019s the one that kept him there for over four years.",
        "Caleb: Fuck. Fuck. That is so fucked up. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Caleb: So Adam is related to some kind of evil scientist who kidnaps people and experiments on them for years?",
        "Dr. Bright: This isn\u2019t a movie, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: I know that, but how else would you say it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Ellie is a scientist who...goes to extreme lengths for her work. ",
        "Caleb: You don\u2019t need to sugarcoat it for me, Dr. Bright. I can feel what\u2019s going on - you\u2019re scared. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m worried. ",
        "Caleb: Doesn\u2019t feel like just worry. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t want you to draw attention to yourself. The AM knows about you but they don\u2019t need to have any reason to look at you more closely. ",
        "Caleb: Why would they even want me?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t think they would. You\u2019re a perfectly normal empath by their standards. ",
        "Caleb: So why are you so scared?",
        "Dr. Bright: Ellie is unpredictable. I\u2019ve been wrong about her in the past, so, when she says she doesn\u2019t have any interest in you, I\u2019m not sure whether I should believe her. ",
        "Caleb: What do you think she would do?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have no idea. I just know that very few people\u2019s lives have improved from an association with that woman. ",
        "Caleb: So what am I supposed to do? I\u2019m not gonna break up with Adam again because he has sketchy relatives. It\u2019s not his fault. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I wasn\u2019t suggesting that at all. If Mark hadn\u2019t said anything, I\u2019m not sure-",
        "Caleb: -you would've told me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m your therapist, Caleb. This entire conversation is completely inappropriate. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but you\u2019re not, like, a normal therapist. And I\u2019m not a normal guy and I don\u2019t have normal problems so we can\u2019t do this normally. I\u2019m glad you told me. Even if you hadn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure Chloe would have.",
        "Dr. Bright: Maybe. ",
        "Caleb: She tells me everything - she calls it atypical solidarity.",
        "Dr. Bright: It doesn\u2019t have to be an \u201cus versus them\u201d dynamic. ",
        "Caleb: But it sort of is, right? I mean, they want to use people like us for experiments and whatever and I get that some people volunteer, but that\u2019s obviously not, like, a requirement for them. And that- that just sucks. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It- yes, it does. ",
        "Caleb: Adam is gonna be crushed. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: I mean, Annabelle is like the one relative he really gets along with. He doesn\u2019t have a ton of family and I don\u2019t know, I think he looks up to her a lot. What- what are feeling right now? It feels kinda warm? Like pride but not. Sadder than that.",
        "Dr. Bright: Annabelle was someone I used to look up to as well. I guess a part of me still remembers what that feels like. ",
        "Caleb: Do you think she- do you think she\u2019s, you know, like, actually evil?",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb, we have already spent far too much of this session talking about my past-",
        "Caleb: Dr. Bright just. Please. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know that anyone is just evil or just good. She\u2019s a complicated person. ",
        "Caleb: I thought I said not to sugarcoat it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not. Caleb, you\u2019re so young- ",
        "Caleb: That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get moral ambiguity. Oh, don\u2019t look all surprised, you\u2019ve met my boyfriend. He\u2019s always saying shit like that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Fair enough. ",
        "Caleb: And even if Adam wasn\u2019t always going on about how much he loves morally gray characters, I can feel people\u2019s feelings, remember? When someone makes a bad choice I can feel what\u2019s really behind it. Like the guys in school that used to bully Adam. They still pick on kids sometimes but now I know what it\u2019s about. They\u2019re mean but they don\u2019t feel mean. They feel scared. They feel scared and small and I know that adults are always telling us that people are dicks because they feel bad about themselves but it\u2019s a lot easier to believe that when you can feel it yourself. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right, Caleb. Fear is a powerful motivator. ",
        "Caleb: Anger too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Caleb: Your- your brother, he\u2019s. It\u2019s been building the whole time and now he\u2019s- he\u2019s really amped up. I can feel him in the waiting room, he\u2019s so- I thought it was fear at first and there is that but he\u2019s so angry too. I feel like there\u2019s something under my skin, I wanna- I wanna do something. Hit something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I apologize, Caleb, I didn\u2019t realize. I\u2019ll go talk to him-",
        "Caleb: No, don\u2019t. Just wait. I need to figure this- what\u2019s his deal? Something really weird is happening, it\u2019s like we\u2019re looping, like something\u2019s glitching. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Mark can emulate the powers of other atypicals.",
        "Caleb: What? So he is an empath?",
        "Dr. Bright: Right now he is. ",
        "Caleb: Ah fuck, I feel so weird. How do I get out of this? No- don\u2019t open the door! That won\u2019t- I don\u2019t want to get closer. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Okay, let\u2019s try those mindfulness exercises. Close your eyes, and refocus on your breathing. ",
        "Caleb: Okay. Okay, okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s good. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Good, Caleb. Okay, now pull your ability back from the waiting room. Imagine it like a fishing line. Let the weight on the other end go and then slowly reel it back in. If it feels like you need to latch onto something else, focus on my emotions. Familiar, calm. And when you\u2019re ready, pull the line in even further until it is contained in you. Feel your emotions and let them move freely through you. ",
        "Caleb: Thanks, Dr. Bright. That got a bit, uh- just, thanks. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course, Caleb. Can you still feel Mark\u2019s emotions?",
        "Caleb: No, not really. He was, uh, calming down with me. And then he just kinda dropped off or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you mind if I check on him?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, that\u2019s fine. I think I\u2019m- I\u2019m good now. ",

        "Dr. Bright: He\u2019s had a tiring day. ",
        "Caleb: Right. Is he gonna be okay? With everything that The AM did to him it felt- it felt bad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re sad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s fine. He\u2019s home. That\u2019s what matters. I\u2019m sorry this session has been so irregular. ",
        "Caleb: What am I gonna tell Adam?",
        "Dr. Bright: You don\u2019t have to tell him anything. ",
        "Caleb: Of course I do. He\u2019ll be upset but- I mean, he was upset when he found out about his parents but we got through it. He knows I\u2019m here for him no matter what.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful, Caleb. I\u2019m very glad you two are so supportive of each other. ",
        "Caleb: Me too. I, uh- sometimes, lately, I feel like everything is gonna come crashing down. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean by that?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just- the past few weeks have been weird, you know? Like, weirder than normal. Meeting Sam, and hanging out with her and Chloe and then now meeting your brother and seeing Damien again, it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, sometimes I forget that there\u2019s a world outside of me and Adam, you know? Especially since things have been so, well, intense with us recently, it\u2019s just been- it's just been kinda nice to live in that little bubble. But I keep meeting all these people like me and it\u2019s cool and I care about them, but- well, Sam and Chloe are my friends but their lives are complicated. And it makes my life complicated and I want to be a part of it because I want to have people in my life who are like me but at the same time I kinda wish I could pretend that whole part of my life doesn\u2019t exist. Does that make sense?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, it does. ",
        "Caleb: And now Adam\u2019s wrapped up in it- even more than before and it\u2019s just. Other high schoolers don\u2019t have to deal with kinda shit, you know? With mind readers and time travelers and creepy government agencies. And I guess sometimes I don\u2019t know how to deal. ",
        "Dr. Bright: From where I\u2019m sitting you\u2019re dealing with all of it extremely well. ",
        "Caleb: Thanks, Dr. Bright. I just don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt. ",

        "Caleb: But Adam-",
        "Dr. Bright: He shouldn\u2019t be involved either. ",
        "Caleb: But he is! Alright? He is. His favorite aunt held your brother hostage!",

        "Dr. Bright: Sometimes the only thing to do in life is move forward. ",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re angry. I- I\u2019ve never felt that from you. Not really. Now you\u2019re surprised. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve been angry for a long time now. I assumed you\u2019d felt that before. ",
        "Caleb: No, I only just noticed it now because it feels like your brother\u2019s- well, not exactly, it\u2019s not exactly the same emotion but it\u2019s like...",
        "Dr. Bright: People who are related have similar qualities to their emotions. Like with Adam and his parents.",
        "Caleb: Right, exactly. Or Alice and my parents. And Mark\u2019s anger, it had this edge to it. And yours has that too. Except your anger, it\u2019s like a- like a whirlpool? Or something? Like it\u2019s spiraling down instead of pouring out like Mark\u2019s and it\u2019s- oh, you\u2019re angry at yourself. That\u2019s why it feels different. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s not an emotion you\u2019ve felt before?",
        "Caleb: Um, not really. I mean, Adam gets down on himself sometimes - and so do other people - but it\u2019s closer to sadness or disappointment. Like it\u2019s less active, or something. Yours is- why are you so mad at yourself?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have also made a number of decisions based on fear. Those types of decisions are usually not good ones. Okay, Caleb, we should move on. Get to some actual therapy-",

        "Dr. Bright: Now slowly bring your focus back into the room. And whenever you\u2019re ready, open your eyes. How do you feel?",
        "Rose: Good. Sort of like I just woke up from a long nap. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you fall asleep?",
        "Rose: No, I don\u2019t think so. But I was- I guess I got more aware of my ability in a way. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean by that?",
        "Rose: Well, there\u2019s a certain feeling I get when I\u2019m in someone\u2019s dream. It\u2019s different than while I\u2019m just dreaming myself. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What does it feel like?",
        "Rose: I don\u2019t know how to describe it really. It\u2019s like, when I\u2019m having my own dreams, it\u2019s like I\u2019m wrapped in cotton. It\u2019s warm and a little hazy and safe. But traveling to someone else\u2019s dream, there\u2019s a- a sharpness to it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: A sharpness?",
        "Rose: No- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right word. It\u2019s not- it\u2019s not a bad feeling. It\u2019s more like stepping outside and having cold air hit your face - the change in temperature is noticeable but it\u2019s kind of refreshing.",
        "Dr. Bright: And you felt that way just now while you were meditating?",
        "Rose: Not exactly. More like the edges of it. Like maybe I could slip into that kind of sleep. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The kind of sleep where you dreamwalk?",
        "Rose: Yeah. And I guess maybe I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything because there\u2019s no one sleeping nearby, but I don\u2019t know, it still felt like a possibility. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful, Rose. Achieving that kind of control after two sessions is very encouraging.",
        "Rose: Thanks. Do you think that I\u2019ll get to a place where I can totally control it? Where I won\u2019t just fall asleep randomly?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think it\u2019s very possible. The AM believes that your narcolepsy-like symptoms are caused by your ability, correct?",
        "Rose: That\u2019s right. They ran all the usual tests to diagnose narcolepsy but it was all pretty, I don\u2019t know...",
        "Dr. Bright: Inconclusive?",
        "Rose: Right. We did the same kinds of meditation exercises but they looked at my brain while we did it and I guess they were able to tell that tapping into my ability is what makes me fall asleep. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I saw that it your file. That isn\u2019t unusual for dreamwalkers - the ability will get triggered randomly and that\u2019s what causes the sleeping spells. If you gain better control and choose to flex your ability regularly, you hopefully won\u2019t fall asleep as randomly. ",
        "Rose: Yeah, that\u2019s what they said too. But then I have to choose whose dreams to go into and that can be, well, people can\u2019t control what they dream about so sometimes I drop in on someone\u2019s nightmare or something and then the next day I have to decide whether or not I tell them that I know they\u2019re afraid of ducks or whatever. It\u2019s awkward. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I can understand it might be uncomfortable to see someone\u2019s subconscious like that. But some dreamwalkers gain such excellent control that they are able to use their power without entering the dreams of others. ",
        "Rose: What do they do?",
        "Dr. Bright: Some look inward, and explore parts of their consciousness that their waking brain can\u2019t access. Others go into what they call a higher plane - something above the consciousness of humans. ",
        "Rose: Really?",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s how they describe it. ",
        "Rose: Wow. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But let\u2019s leave all that for the time being and focus on minimizing the disruption to your life. That\u2019s the first step. ",
        "Rose: Right. Okay. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you gone back to work yet?",
        "Rose: Not yet. The restaurant has been really good about me taking some time off. But they also don\u2019t want someone working in a kitchen who might fall asleep at any moment. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I imagine that might be hazardous. ",
        "Rose: I really hope to go back soon. I mean, I can usually feel when it\u2019s about to happen and get out of the way. And even though I\u2019m living with my parents, I\u2019m still so far away from having even the first semester\u2019s tuition for culinary school. And then there\u2019s these sessions- ",
        "Dr. Bright: The AM is subsidizing them. That\u2019s one of the benefits of doing their program. ",
        "Rose: I know, but that\u2019s only for six months, right? I have a feeling I\u2019m not gonna be perfectly in control after six months. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re right, I definitely encourage all my patients to do therapy regularly. Mental wellbeing is a lifelong pursuit. But I also know that not everyone can afford the expense. We can work something out when the time comes. But you don\u2019t need to worry about it right now. ",
        "Rose: You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. Like my dad is always telling my mom: \u201cdon\u2019t go borrowing trouble\u201d. Which she never listens to because, well, she knows when trouble is coming. She can\u2019t help but worry about the future. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Anxiety about the future is a natural human impulse. But it doesn\u2019t serve us to dwell on it too much. Our time\u2019s almost up, but do you have any other pressing concerns that you\u2019d like to talk about?",
        "Rose: Um, yes, actually. I\u2019ve been seeing someone for a little while - we\u2019ve gone on a bunch of dates over the past two months, but it\u2019s not really serious. Not yet. And its not that I don\u2019t want to commit, but it\u2019s- it\u2019s hard to really share your life with someone when you can\u2019t stay over or nap with them on the couch, you know? And also, I don\u2019t like lying - I had to tell her I was going traveling for two weeks when I was at The AM and I still feel really weird about it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you seen her since finishing the program?",
        "Rose: Yeah, I have. I like her so much and I\u2019d like to actually make her my girlfriend but I just- even if I\u2019m getting better control and can avoid going into her dreams, I\u2019m still keeping this huge thing from her. So I guess I was just wondering, what do your patients do usually? The AM made everything seem pretty secretive but my family has always been so open about it, at least with each other. My parents always told my brother to not go around flashing it when his ability started, but can I tell people? Is that allowed?",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s not a choice anyone can make for you, Rose. Most of the people I know choose to only tell those closest to them - their immediate family, best friends, spouses, partners. It\u2019s true that The AM doesn\u2019t want atypicals to go around broadcasting it-",
        "Rose: Yeah, they made that very clear. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But it\u2019s your decision to make. I would suggest caution. Not everyone reacts well and it is a very personal thing to share. Make sure you trust the person first. But other than that, it\u2019s really up to you. ",
        "Rose: Okay. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tell her just yet but, I don\u2019t know, I really feel like we could be something and this isn\u2019t a part of my life I\u2019m willing to hide from a serious girlfriend. ",
        "Dr. Bright: See? You already know your boundaries - trust your instincts. ",

        "Mark: No, no, it\u2019s fine, I was awake already. It\u2019s just- well they had these big machines - monitors and stuff - in the room where they did the experiments. And they made this really loud, growling hum. Really distinctive sound, you know? ",
        "Dr. Bright: At The AM?",
        "Mark: Yeah, where else? And the construction next door...it just- it kind of sounded like that. So I had to get out of there. Went to Sam\u2019s place but she wasn\u2019t home which is weird. But then I remembered about the scotch, so here I am! ",

        "Mark: Sam doesn\u2019t push but, yeah, sometimes we talk about it. Chloe knows everything before I open my mouth and then we\u2019re just sitting there staring at each other not talking- it drives Sam nuts. When we go nonverbal, you know? ",
        "Dr. Bright: No one likes being left out. How are things going with you two?",

But Sam\u2019s not like that, which is good, because I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready for anything and I don\u2019t- I don't know how to- I think I\u2019m really fucked up, Joanie. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You need to give yourself a break. You were in captivity for nearly five years. It\u2019s going to be hard to adjust. ",
        "Mark: I just- Sam hates going out in public, you know? I mean, she says she\u2019s gotten better about it since starting therapy with you but it\u2019s- well, it\u2019s really kind of nice to just sit inside with her and Darwin and not worry about things. But she\u2019s always suggesting that we go out and do stuff because I\u2019ve missed so much and she knows I love being out and about because that\u2019s what I told her but it\u2019s not- that\u2019s not true anymore. It\u2019s- it\u2019s too overwhelming when I don\u2019t know who is around, or if there are any other atypicals, and I forget- I forget that I can be seen and heard when I\u2019m in public now so sometimes I\u2019m talking to myself and I don\u2019t realize until I notice everyone staring at me like I\u2019m crazy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Mark, you need to go see a therapist. Someone not me, not Sam, not atypical-related, and talk about this. ",

        "Mark: I can\u2019t, I can't- I- I- I can\u2019t trust anyone. And Sam can tell, and it\u2019s not fair, because she\u2019s the only- she\u2019s the only one who has any idea what it was like to be alone for that long and I don\u2019t trust her. When she tries to get me to go out for dinner or to a movie, I know she\u2019s doing it because she cares about me and she wants me to be happy, even if it means going outside of her comfort zone, but all I can think about is what her motivations for getting me out of the apartment are. Is she setting a trap for me? Does she want to get rid of me? Does she not want me anymore? And it\u2019s not fair, she doesn\u2019t deserve my suspicion, she\u2019s done nothing but care for me and give me space and time when I need it and I don\u2019t trust her. I can\u2019t. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Some are referred by other atpyicals, others...",
        "Mark: Others by The AM?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. As you said, they occasionally do good work. ",
        "Mark: Why still send patients to you, though? I mean, after everything that happened?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have the necessary training for this work. The AM poured a lot of money into training me, making me effective - it makes sense that they\u2019d want to continue to take advantage of that. Their employees are a big investment. Even the people who leave usually end up being consultants like me. ",
        "Mark: Have you heard from her?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. ",
        "Mark: Seriously? She just backed off completely?",
        "Dr. Bright: Only in the sense that she hasn\u2019t reached out. ",
        "Mark: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: She knows it would drive me crazy- her going completely quiet. This is a classic Wadsworth game. Stop our meetings, stop calling me, stop asking me to come back to The AM, and eventually I\u2019ll go crawling back on my own. ",
        "Mark: She really thinks that would work?",
        "Dr. Bright: She knows that it means I\u2019m spending more time and energy thinking about her than before. If I don\u2019t see her or talk to her, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. I\u2019m just always waiting for the other shoe to drop. ",
        "Mark: Jesus, what is the deal with you two?",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Mark: This twisted, mad-scientist mind game shit the two of you have. What does she want from you?",
        "Dr. Bright: Control. I think- looking back on our time working together, I was so caught up in admiring her, in being impressed by her, that I didn\u2019t realize how controlling she was. I thought she was trying to groom me, make me her protege, but the more I think about it the more I think that she was just trying to keep me under her thumb. Keep me from being the competition. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Are you sure you want to know?",
        "Mark: Is it that bad?",
        "Dr. Bright: No, it\u2019s- he\u2019s doing better. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s healthy for you to have any kind of contact with him right now. ",
        "Mark: Yeah, well, not my therapist, remember? Besides, I don\u2019t have any contact with him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And I\u2019d like to keep it that way, so you need to get out of here. Go see a movie or something. ",

        "Mark: Joanie. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know, Mark. His ability to make his own choices has gotten much stronger. He- he only does what I say about twenty percent of the time now. But he still can\u2019t impose his own will on others.",
        "Mark: Have you figured out what happened?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have my theories. ",
        "Mark: Well, such as?",
        "Dr. Bright: Damien\u2019s power is normally an outward one - he pushes his will out to other people. I think when you had your outburst, it got reversed and opened up his brain to incoming signals. Now it\u2019s just about closing his mind back up so that other people\u2019s desires don\u2019t get in. It seems to be working so far. ",

        "Dr. Bright: It certainly could be. He could have full use of his power again. ",
        "Mark: No, I don\u2019t want him to be like this forever. I didn\u2019t mean to break him. I know what it\u2019s like to not be able to feel your own ability. It was like not being able to detect your own heartbeat. Not painful, just creepy. I don\u2019t want that for anyone, not even Damien. ",

But there\u2019s that lingering part of my emotions - just on the surface - that trusts him. I hate it. I hate that he made it so that I can\u2019t even trust my own goddamn feelings.

There, we would monitor them twenty-four-seven, even while they were sleeping. It seems silly for Rose and I to take a nap during a session but I\u2019m not sure what other way we can flex her ability.

Then again, we do make the silliest decisions when we\u2019re teenagers, don\u2019t we? I distinctly recall going through a very unfortunate grunge phase myself. But I grew out of it - moved into adulthood and left behind the childish identity politics. I suppose that\u2019s not for everyone. ",

I\u2019d never had that.

God, I had years to just sit and think about it. And it all fit together- you had a job that you loved and you couldn\u2019t talk about it and you admired your boss and there was that guy that you thought maybe had a crush on you- I mean, everything you\u2019d been telling me before I got taken, it all matched up. Well, the Agent Green thing I didn\u2019t figure out on my own but Wadsworth- it was clear she was always the smartest person in the room. Of course you\u2019d look up to her.

        "Wadsworth: Oh? Do tell. ",
        "Damien: You wouldn\u2019t find it in those little files of yours. Not everything\u2019s as cut-and-dry as speeding or breaking and entering. ",

        "Damien: Sometimes. ",
        "Wadsworth: How?",
        "Damien: I learned that it's easier to run from the law if you've convinced the law it was someone else. Same logic works in bar fights too. ",
        "Wadsworth: You create fall guys.",
        "Damien: Or girls. I\u2019m not picky. ",
        "Wadsworth: Has anyone ever died?",

        "Wadsworth: You don\u2019t sound particularly broken up about it. ",
        "Damien: Should I be? I admit, it\u2019s not ideal. The best cons are the ones that don\u2019t have any fall guys - convincing my landlord that I\u2019ve already paid rent for the month, making waiters think I\u2019ve already paid, stuff like that. With those I can just slip away before anyone wises up. Things get messy when you have to create a diversion with another person. ",
        "Wadsworth: And how does that work? You manipulate a person into thinking someone else stole their car or whatever it may be?",
        "Damien: Exactly. And, hey, I can\u2019t control how that person chooses to react.  It\u2019s- well, it's not my fault if they decide to take more direct action. ",
        "Wadsworth: Do you really believe that?",
        "Damien: Like I said, it\u2019s messy. But it\u2019s survival of the fittest. I\u2019m not going to apologize for that. ",
        "Wadsworth: Nor should you. See? Sharing wasn\u2019t all that hard after all. It\u2019s amazing what you\u2019ll open up about when avoiding a difficult personal question. ",

        "Wadsworth: I am. But you\u2019re also very easy. All you really want is for someone to listen - actually listen. I'm sorry Joan couldn\u2019t be that for you. Though I\u2019m sure she tried her best. ",
        "Damien: You give her too much credit. She never actually tried with me. ",

        "Damien: I\u2019m not the professional in our relationship. ",

        "Wadsworth: Therapy isn\u2019t my specialty but I\u2019ve dabbled enough to know it has to be a two-way street. Even in my own work, I have to acknowledge that things are much easier if the patient is there voluntarily. ",

        "Damien: Well, we\u2019ve been talking for more than five minutes and you haven\u2019t tried to kill me, so that\u2019s already an improvement over my last social interaction. ",

        "Wadsworth: You don\u2019t think things through, do you?",
        "Damien: I don\u2019t have to. I can fix anything by just wanting someone to believe something. I make a point to be smart but I don\u2019t have to be careful. ",

        "Caleb: No, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m going to be eighteen in four months and I\u2019m- I mean, I\u2019ve done things\u2014 I don\u2019t feel like a kid anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. Do you want to sit down?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, thanks. ",
        "[sfx: door closing, both sitting]",
        "Dr. Bright: How have you been doing?",
        "Caleb: Okay. I\u2019m glad that I\u2014 well, that the holiday break came when it did. Even though it was a bit weird this year. Obviously.",
        "Dr. Bright:  Why was it weird?",
        "Caleb: I mean, my parents spent the whole break looking at me like I was gonna lose it at any second. It wasn\u2019t exactly relaxing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry to hear that. ",
        "Caleb: And Adam went to Ohio to be with his dad\u2019s family for Hanukkah so I didn\u2019t even get to hang out with him and, well, his parents are kind of freaked out. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: Because of what I did. They- they\u2019re worried. I mean, they know I would never hurt Adam but, I guess, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s complicated. Adam says his mom and his aunt are in a pretty big fight about the whole thing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I see. ",
        "Caleb: Was your Christmas okay?",
        "Dr. Bright: This isn't about me, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Why not? This isn\u2019t a therapy session, remember? You don\u2019t have to talk to me like a patient.",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m confused, Caleb - what exactly is it that you want from me?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t want anything from you. I just- I miss you, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Therapists don\u2019t typically have contact with their patients after they\u2019ve stopped sessions with them. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but there\u2019s nothing typical about any of this. That\u2019s, like, the whole point. This has never been a normal doctor-patient relationship. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. ",
        "Caleb: Then why can\u2019t we just talk? As, like, human beings. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Because I was supposed to protect you. And I failed. ",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: My job - my only role in your life - is to help you. It\u2019s to guide you through living with your ability and make sure that your mental health is attended to. And I failed. ",
        "Caleb: We\u2019ve been through this\u2014 it\u2019s not your fault. Maybe things wouldn\u2019t have turned out exactly the way they did if I didn\u2019t know you, but I\u2019d still be with Adam and his aunt would still be who she is. That, like, has nothing to do with you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know, Caleb. It\u2019s not that, it\u2019s-",
        "Caleb: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: I should have been there for you. In November. I should have- I should have helped you during that crisis. But I froze. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, and I should have listened to you more about mindfulness and all that stuff and not gone off the deep end. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m your therapist, Caleb. You were in emotional turmoil and I did nothing. And I am incredibly sorry about that. ",
        "Caleb: That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t put up a fight, isn\u2019t it? With my parents.",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Caleb: I expected for you to, I don\u2019t know, to push back. But my mom said you jumped right on board with them. That you thought it was a good idea for me to go see someone else. And, like, that was it. My parents didn\u2019t even talk to me before coming to you. And it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not their fucking choice in the first place, and you should have known that and I shouldn\u2019t have just let them decide for me, but I could feel how scared they were and I just, I wasn\u2019t- I couldn\u2019t take fighting with them anymore. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You haven\u2019t often fought with your parents very much in the past, have you?",
        "Caleb: Nah, not really. Not since my thing first started and I was yo-yoing all over the place. I mean, they\u2019ve been really great for the most part. And I\u2019m lucky. Like, believe me, I know that. They could have freaked out way back then and they didn\u2019t, they just tried to find a way to help me. But, like, after the whole thing with Damien, they totally blew their fucking lids. I mean, you know that, you were there\u2014 ",
        "Dr. Bright: Only for a moment. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, sorry about that. They shouldn\u2019t have thrown you out like that. But, you know, son gets dropped off by his therapist covered in blood...",
        "Dr. Bright: I understood their reaction completely. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. It was like that for days. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I imagine that was difficult for you to deal with - all those emotions swirling around the house. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah, it was bad. But Alice stayed calm during all of it, somehow, and having Adam over really helped. When he was allowed, I mean. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Allowed?",
        "Caleb: His parents wigged like mine when they got the whole story. Like I said, I think they know that I would never hurt Adam but, well, I don\u2019t even know that. Not really. Not for sure. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that something you worry about?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. I mean, not just with Adam. With anyone. The first couple weeks after, everything was so tense and, like, at a fucking boiling point, and I had to finish my college apps and something\u2019s going on with Alice underneath all that calm, I don\u2019t even know what, and there were times when I just couldn\u2019t see, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean? You physically couldn\u2019t see?",
        "Caleb: Yeah, kind of. Like, my body just gets so full of toxic bullshit that I get this tunnel vision and I feel it- that feeling of wanting to hit something. Of wanting to, I don\u2019t know, just, like, explode. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You felt that way when you first came to see me, do you remember? And it was difficult, but you learned how to manage it. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, but his feels worse. It\u2019s like I let something loose and now it won\u2019t stay quiet. And the thing is- I\u2019d do it again. If it came down to it, if I had to hurt someone to protect Adam, or my family, I\u2019d do it. You\u2019re scared of me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I\u2019m not. ",
        "Caleb: I can feel it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I am scared, Caleb. But not of you. ",
        "Caleb: Of what I might do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of you letting this rule you. ",
        "Caleb: What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re an incredibly kind boy, Caleb.",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m not a boy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. You\u2019re a good man. With a good heart. And that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t have these impulses - these angry feelings - but you shouldn\u2019t let that destroy the kindness in you. I don\u2019t want you to become vindictive. ",
        "Caleb: Have you been talking to Sam?",
        "Dr. Bright: What?",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re both worried about me going after Damien, aren\u2019t you? Finishing what I started?",
        "Dr. Bright: What? No, of course not. Why? Is- is that something you\u2019ve thought about?",
        "Caleb: No. I mean, yeah, I\u2019ve thought about it, I guess. But I wouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think so. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think Sam was worried you\u2019d try to apologize. ",
        "Caleb: To Damien?",
        "Dr. Bright: That you\u2019d try to get closure that way. Neither of us thinks that\u2019s a good idea. ",
        "Caleb: No. No, trust me, if I never see that guy again I\u2019ll be happy. Why does she think I\u2019d want to apologize? Is it- does she- Mark\u2019s been telling her stuff, huh? And you, I guess?",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you haven\u2019t seen him very much but he\u2019s-",
        "Caleb: -picked up on stuff. Yeah, Sam said. What exactly has he been feeling from me?",
        "Dr. Bright: Guilt. ",
        "Caleb: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019ve been feeling guilty?",
        "Caleb: Mark has been. So has Sam. And so do you. Like, all the fucking time. That\u2019s why you guys are all fixating on that. But, look, I get it. When I was first getting used to my ability, it was sometimes easiest to feel things that were close to what I was already feeling. I see people doing this all the time. People are always putting their own bullshit onto somebody else and saying it was their\u2019s all along. ",
        "Dr. Bright: So you don\u2019t feel guilt about what happened?",
        "Caleb: Jesus, okay, we need to stop talking around it. Nothing \u201chappened\u201d. I did something. I beat a guy close to death. And yeah. Yeah, I feel guilty. Because sometimes I fall asleep and I wake up with fear on my tongue and I realize it\u2019s not mine, it\u2019s his. His fear, his pain, and just- just a little, tiny part of him that felt, like, victorious. Like he was happy somebody was finally punching his stupid fucking face in. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re still feeling his emotions? ",
        "Caleb: No. No, it\u2019s not like that. Not exactly. It\u2019s like- it\u2019s like having a nightmare or something. Like some sort of weird aftershock. Because I don\u2019t know that I processed it all at the time, you know, because there were too many- there was just so fucking much. But in the days right after, it was like having an empathy hangover. Not the kind that I was having at Sam\u2019s party, not the actual hangover, but, like, so much got poured into my body and as I worked through all of it, I felt things, like, one by one. It was like detoxing or withdrawing or something, except instead of sweating out chemicals, I was just swinging from feeling to feeling. And, like, every now and then, something pops up totally randomly - like- I don't know, like, the feelings are like an old injury that hurts if you move it the wrong way.",
        "Dr. Bright: Has something like that ever happened before?",
        "Caleb: No. Not this bad. Not this much. I never felt like I was, like, a container that could carry around people\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s, like, all too big for me to push away. What? You\u2019ve got that feeling where you\u2019re holding something back. Just say it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Holding something back is an emotion?",
        "Caleb: It is with you. You hold in, like, a lot. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m trying not to be your therapist. If this is just a social call, it\u2019s not my job to diagnose you. ",
        "Caleb: So if this wasn\u2019t a social call?",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Trauma, right? That\u2019s what you want to talk about. PTSD. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that what you think?",
        "Caleb: That\u2019s what my other- my therapist says. I didn\u2019t tell him the whole thing, just the basics of, you know, a violent event and, yeah. He thinks I\u2019ve got to deal with some trauma. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Has he been helping you do so?",
        "Caleb: I mean, the best he can, I guess. But Adam is more helpful than ten non-atypical therapists put together. He\u2019s really good at keeping me in that green place, that good mix of his feelings and mine. That helps. But\u2014 but he\u2019s scared. I can feel it. And I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s scared of me or of Annabelle or of Damien or what, but he\u2019s scared. And I don\u2019t know how to make him not be scared.",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you talked to him about it?",
        "Caleb: No. I\u2019ve been too scared to. Fucking ironic. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What are you afraid of?",
        "Caleb: That he\u2019ll tell me it\u2019s me he\u2019s scared of after all. That he doesn\u2019t look at me the same way. That he can\u2019t be with me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you have any reason to believe that he feels that way?",
        "Caleb: No. I mean, he told me the exact opposite but that was, like, right after and, I don\u2019t know, his feelings could have changed. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think they have?",
        "Caleb: He got into Yale. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful.",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Yeah it is, I guess. I mean, he\u2019s so stoked. Like, I\u2019ve never felt him as happy as he was when he heard he got in. We were in different classes on, like, opposite ends of the building and all of a sudden I got punched in the stomach with, like, this pure joy. And I knew, I knew it was him. The moment the bell rang, I ran to find him and it took, like, two seconds because I just followed the feeling and there he was with this, like, stupid huge smile on his face. I\u2019ve only ever felt him that psyched maybe, like, once. ",
        "Dr. Bright: When was that?",
        "Caleb: Our first kiss. That was the first time I saw him really smile. This was definitely like that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you\u2019re worried that this means his feelings about you have changed?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Well, no. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m happy for him, for sure. But, like, I\u2019m not gonna get into Yale. I didn\u2019t even apply. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re very smart, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, thanks, but tell that to my grades. I spent most of junior year completely flipping out and then getting my first boyfriend. Neither are great for schoolwork. And god, my grades from last semester were, like, bad.",
        "Dr. Bright: I take it you didn\u2019t apply early like Adam?",
        "Caleb: Nah. I just sent in my apps a few weeks ago. Now for the waiting. And, like, yeah, I applied to some places that are within driving distance to Yale but even if we\u2019re close, we\u2019re not in the same spot and he\u2019s gonna be around a bunch of brilliant nerds like him and I\u2019m just- you know, with everything that\u2019s happened and him going to a new place with new people, I\u2019m just worried I\u2019ll be left behind. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You have months left in your senior year, Caleb. There\u2019s no purpose in borrowing trouble. Try to focus on the present and enjoy the here and now. ",
        "Caleb: Is anybody actually able to do that? Like, do people actually enjoy the present without freaking out about the future?",
        "Dr. Bright: I have no idea. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn't try. ",
        "Caleb: Are you able to do that? Enjoy the present?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m certainly trying to. It\u2019s a little easier now that Mark is back. ",
        "Caleb: But that frustrates you?",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Caleb: Mark being back, it\u2019s making you feel, I don\u2019t know, it's like, unsettled or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I suppose if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t really know what to do now. The past few years have been spent laser-focused on getting Mark home and safe and now that he is, I\u2019m not sure what the next step is. Not to mention, I\u2019ve lost about half my patients for one reason or another. And I\u2019m certainly not consulting with The AM anymore. ",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re not?",
        "Dr. Bright: Agent Green still calls to check in occasionally, but I\u2019m officially off their payroll. I think Ellie is hoping it will drive me back there. ",
        "Caleb: Have you talked to her at all?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Adam hasn\u2019t either. I guess Mrs. Hayes and Annabelle are seriously on the outs. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That doesn\u2019t surprise me. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, well, no kidding. I\u2019d be pissed too if I were Adam\u2019s mom. Her sister put her son in, like, a huge amount of danger. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And yet you can\u2019t understand why your parents don\u2019t want you seeing me anymore?",
        "Caleb: No, I understand it, I just think it\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s not the same situation. It sounds like Annabelle basically trash talked Damien until he snapped. At least you were leaving him alone. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to make you sad. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s not you. I just- I wonder if I could have helped. There\u2019s always an amount of lingering doubt around patients you\u2019re unable to help. I worry that I lost patience with Damien too soon. Maybe there was something more I could have done.",
        "Caleb: Did he ever seem like he really wanted help? Like he wanted to do the work?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. He wanted answers - a solution to his control problem, more information about atypicals - but he was always completely unwilling to do the work to get there. ",
        "Caleb: When we first started, you told me I had to meet you halfway. Like, that\u2019s how it works, right? You can\u2019t help someone if they don\u2019t want to help themselves or, like, whatever the saying is. ",
        "Dr. Bright: When did you get so wise?",
        "Caleb: I don't know, I\u2019ve been reading up on psych stuff a bit. I wanted to make sure I applied to, like, the right schools. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re still thinking you might use your ability to do social work?",
        "Caleb: Yeah. Or, I don't know, something like that. I know I\u2019m not in the best shape at the moment, but I\u2019m willing to do the work to get back to where I was. Especially if it means something like that never happens again.",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful to hear Caleb. But you know there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll completely get rid of those angry impulses. ",
        "Caleb: I know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t say it to be discouraging. It\u2019s just that sometimes the work we do is consistent; focusing on getting through every day rather than aiming for a time when everything is perfect. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re in bad shape now - quite the opposite in fact, considering. You\u2019ve been calling out the shifts in my emotions very confidently. And accurately. ",
        "Caleb: It\u2019s gotten easier with you. I know you better now and, well, I don\u2019t know, your emotions are closer to the surface now. I think maybe having Mark back has made you, like, more emotional. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, that sounds right. Having him back with me is like walking around with an open wound that anyone can poke a stick at. It\u2019s incredibly vulnerable. ",
        "Caleb: For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing. Emotional you, I mean. It\u2019s- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s nice. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Thank you, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: And Mark isn\u2019t in danger anymore, right? So you don\u2019t have to worry about being vulnerable or whatever. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Mark will always be in some degree of danger, simply because of who he is. Ellie may have backed off, but there are others who would love to get their hands on him, I\u2019m sure. ",
        "Caleb: Others? Wait, as in like other AMs?",
        "Dr. Bright: In this country, yes, other branches. ",
        "Caleb: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Dr. Bright: North America isn\u2019t the only continent with atypicals, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Well, yeah, sure, but, wait, there are other creepy science organizations like The AM?",
        "Dr. Bright: The AM is a fairly recent institution. It was only founded in the thirties. Atypicals have existed for much longer than that. ",
        "Caleb: What, so you\u2019re saying there\u2019s like - like, a global conspiracy?",
        "Dr. Bright: I wouldn\u2019t go that far. But monitoring organizations have always existed. ",
        "Caleb: Like what?",
        "Dr. Bright: I think that\u2019s enough of that. You don\u2019t need to go digging into what else is out there. ",
        "Caleb: You can\u2019t just leave me hanging like that!",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I can, Caleb. I may not be your therapist anymore, but I\u2019m still going to try and protect you. ",
        "Caleb: And these other organizations, they're dangerous?",
        "Dr. Bright: I honestly have no idea. I don\u2019t actually know that much about them myself. Many of them are highly secretive. I\u2019m going to assume there\u2019s a reason for that. ",
        "Caleb: Like, more secretive than The AM?",
        "Dr. Bright: Much more. ",
        "Caleb: Jesus. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Indeed. Why are you smiling?",
        "Caleb: Adam is gonna absolutely flip when I tell him this. Like, I know it\u2019s all serious - secrets, danger, blah, blah, blah - but it\u2019s also really fucking cool. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Can you just promise me you two will stop with the amateur sleuthing?",
        "Caleb: I could, but I\u2019d be lying. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Caleb\u2014",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re not always going to be able to protect me, Dr. Bright. No matter where I go to school next year, eventually I\u2019m gonna leave and be on my own and you won\u2019t be there to tell me when I\u2019m doing something stupid. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. ",
        "Caleb: No, please don\u2019t get all sad, you feel like my parents. They\u2019re going through the same thing. I get it, it\u2019s what you guys do, it\u2019s hard to let go or whatever, but I\u2019ll be fine. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know you will be. I think you\u2019re going to have a wonderful life, Caleb. ",
        "Caleb: Jeeze, don\u2019t say it like I\u2019m gonna walk out of here and you\u2019re never going to see me again. I was serious about the being friends thing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s very sweet, Caleb, but you don\u2019t need to come visit me. ",
        "Caleb: I want to, Dr. Bright. I, like, care about you and stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I care about you too. ",
        "Caleb: Cool, great, so can we cut it out with all the guilt crap, alright? You\u2019re not responsible for every bad thing that happens to people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. But I do sincerely apologize for not being there for you in November. ",
        "Caleb: I get it, okay? Everyone was freaking out, you were worried about Mark and dealing with the fact that Damien looked the way he did. None of you were prepared for that. I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t had to deal with that kind of messed up violence in therapy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: There have been incidents in the past but you\u2019re right. I was unprepared. I\u2019m very thankful Frank was there. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, same here. Dude is really good to have around in a crisis. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know this isn\u2019t a session, but do you want to talk more about what happened? About how you feel?",
        "Caleb: I don\u2019t know. Not right now, I don\u2019t think. It comes and goes in waves, you know? Like, right now I feel good because you feel good - I think you\u2019re happy that I\u2019m okay - but I also still have nightmares about it. But it\u2019s hard to think about how bad it makes me feel when I\u2019m not in it, you know?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I understand that. ",
        "Caleb: I guess that might change now that Damien\u2019s getting out though. Have you heard from him?",
        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure which day exactly he\u2019s being released, but I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll coming running to my office when he is. ",
        "Caleb: You\u2019re not worried he might, like, want revenge or something? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Damien is impulsive and largely acts out of desperation and fear. He\u2019s not a planner. In fact, if there\u2019s anyone who knows how to be in the present moment, it\u2019s probably him. ",
        "Caleb: Guess I should go ask him for some tips then. I was joking. So what do you think he\u2019ll do?",
        "Dr. Bright: I don\u2019t know. Depending on his experience there, he might turn his focus onto the AM - he\u2019s always had a bit of a fixation on them anyway - but I imagine that his first priority will be survival. It always is. And, given that The AM is letting him go, I think his ability is probably significantly diminished, which would mean he\u2019d have to learn how to live without it. ",
        "Caleb: You\u2019ve thought a lot about this. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I suppose I have. ",
        "Caleb: Is he your new mission? Now that you have Mark back?",
        "Dr. Bright: Definitely not. I\u2019m certainly keeping an eye out, but I will not be going out of my way to ever see him again. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, you and me both. Think we\u2019re likely to get our way?",
        "Dr. Bright: I doubt it. ",
        "Caleb: Right. I should probably get going - my parents are gonna start wondering where I am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. ",
        "Caleb: All of a sudden I have a very strict schedule. It\u2019s annoying as fuck. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sorry. ",
        "Caleb: Eh, it\u2019s okay. I guess having overbearing parents means I\u2019ve had at least one part of a normal high school experience. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re also star of the football team and have a very nice boyfriend, so I\u2019d say you have at least a few items in the normal column. ",
        "Caleb: I\u2019m not the star.",
        "Dr. Bright: So that wasn\u2019t you I read about in the local paper?",
        "Caleb: Well, I did have a lot of stuff to work out this fall and I left it all on the field, I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Very successfully, it seems. ",
        "Caleb: Whatever. I\u2019m sorry you never got to a game. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m not sure that would have been appropriate. ",

        "[sfx: closing door, both sitting]",

        "Dr. Bright: I take it your stay at The AM was helpful?",
        "Rose: Yeah, it was. I think it was the right call, going back in. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m glad to hear it. Could you walk me through your time there? I- they haven\u2019t sent the file over to me yet. ",
        "Rose: Didn\u2019t Agent Green call? He said he was going to fill you in. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ah. He did. I missed the call and didn\u2019t- I haven\u2019t had the time to call him back. ",
        "Rose: Gotcha. Well, it was a bit like the first time around, to be honest. Except more...a little more rigorous, I guess. They helped me, well, detox, for lack of a better word. Put me in a room that\u2019s meant to block atypical abilities, gave me sleeping pills to put me in a really deep sleep, that kind of stuff. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How did you feel about that?",
        "Rose: It was kind of scary at first. But it helped. I haven\u2019t had a dreamless night of sleep in months, you know that. And when I dream, I want to dream more and then I sleep more and then I\u2019m not awake and not living and that\u2019s what got me into this mess in the first place. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you feel like your life is a mess?",
        "Rose: Less so than I did two weeks ago. But, yeah, okay, not really. It had gotten messy, but wasn\u2019t yet quite a mess. It would have been though, had I kept going. I can\u2019t sleep through my life. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, you can't. But I do think there\u2019s a balance to be found. Your relationship to dreamwalking isn\u2019t a standard addiction and shouldn\u2019t be treated like one. ",
        "Rose: I know. And I know that you weren't on board with me going back to The AM. But it did help. They think there\u2019s a balance to be found too. But I needed that week of just no dreaming. It was really hard at first. Empty and lonely and I woke up with that itch under my skin but after the first few nights, I was waking up rested. And actually looking forward to my day. To being out in the world, talking to real people. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s wonderful, Rose. You said it was only the first week that you had a dreamless sleep?",
        "Rose: Yeah. The second week they put me in a different room and let me walk. And then during the day we would do stuff similar to what I\u2019ve been doing with you - the talk therapy, mindfulness, trying to focus on enjoying the present reality. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did you find that helpful?",
        "Rose: None of their shrinks were as good as you, but, yeah, it helped. It was just nice to be in an environment I could be honest in, you know? When I had these moments throughout the day when I wanted to go to sleep and walk around, I could just say so. And they would talk me through why that impulse was coming up and help me work through it. Or sometimes just distract me from the itch. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did that make it easier to wake up in the mornings?",
        "Rose: Mostly. There were still times that I wanted to stay in the dream world. It\u2019s just so- sometimes I think that learning to control it was the worst thing I could have done. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why do you say that?",
        "Rose: Don\u2019t get me wrong - I\u2019m relieved to not be falling asleep at the drop of a hat, but being in control brings its own problems, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "Dr. Bright: You mean choosing to go into dreams.",
        "Rose: Right. I never expected it to be this easy. Based on everything The AM told me when I first went there and all the stuff you said in our first session, I expected it to take forever. Gaining control, that is. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You adjusted remarkably quickly. ",
        "Rose: Do you think it\u2019s because I come from an atypical family? That there\u2019s something in our DNA that makes us really good at this?",
        "Dr. Bright: Did your brother have an easy time learning his ability when it first started up?",
        "Rose: I guess. It also only took him a couple months to get used to reading minds and learning how to lower and raise the volume on them. Though, he was at The AM for two whole months, so that might have made things easier. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Does it bother you that you had an easier time than you expected?",
        "Rose: I don\u2019t know. It bothers me how quickly I got sucked into it. In the beginning, I was so worried about going into people\u2019s dreams and learning stuff about them but now I want to do it. I understand Aaron a lot better now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you mean?",
        "Rose: His telepathy. He likes hearing people\u2019s thoughts. I didn\u2019t get that. I just thought it was really annoying to have a brother who could hear what I was thinking. And a little creepy. But it\u2019s not a voyeuristic thing for him. He tried to explain it to me once. That he wasn\u2019t listening to spy on people or to learn their deep dark secrets, but to understand them. He talks about how it\u2019s not just the thoughts themselves but the shapes of them- the patterns they make. He makes it sound like art or music. Something beautiful. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And that\u2019s what dreams are like for you?",
        "Rose: Yeah, they are beautiful. I wish I could show them to you. To see what I see...it makes people make sense. I mean, dreams don\u2019t always make sense obviously. A lot of the time it\u2019s just visual gibberish. Well, and sometimes actual gibberish. But once I got good at going into dreams, it was easier to find the truth. ",
        "Dr. Bright: The truth?",
        "Rose: People\u2019s true thoughts and feelings. Or, at least, some of them. Everything that lies underneath. Everything that people try to bury everyday. You can\u2019t hide from those when you dream. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And those are the things that you enjoy seeing?",
        "Rose: When they\u2019re not nightmares, yeah. And I\u2019m getting better at dealing with the nightmares too. ",
        "Dr. Bright: They don\u2019t frighten you anymore?",
        "Rose: I still get startled, sure, but I can usually shift the dream away from them pretty quickly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Rose: If I\u2019m inside someone\u2019s nightmare, I can stop it. I can help them dream about something else. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2019re controlling dreams?",
        "Rose: I guess. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How long has this been going on?",
        "Rose: Since the holidays?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why didn\u2019t you mention this at our last session?",
        "Rose: I don\u2019t know. I guess I was scared of what you\u2019d think. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What did you fear I\u2019d say?",
        "Rose: That it wasn\u2019t okay. That I was crossing some boundary that shouldn\u2019t be crossed. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think you\u2019re crossing a boundary?",
        "Rose: I know I am. Of course I am. But I wasn\u2019t even doing it on purpose at first. My mom was having a nightmare and it was awful and I was there, thinking about how I wanted to make it stop, wanted her to dream about something nice and then she was. She started dreaming about me. As a little kid. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you felt that your presence there was the reason for the change?",
        "Rose: Not at first. But then I went to Aaron\u2019s dreams the next night and he was lucid dreaming and\u2014  ",
        "Dr. Bright: Meaning he could see you?",
        "Rose: Yeah, exactly. And we were in the snow and he was teasing me like always and then snowballs just starting hitting him. It was hilarious. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you did that?",
        "Rose: Not on purpose. But I was thinking about how I wanted to wipe that stupid smug look off his face and then snowballs started throwing themselves. He got instantly wigged out because of course he heard my thoughts and normally that means he can get the drop on me in our fights, but a snowball pelted him in the face before he could even lean down to make one himself. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Your brother can hear your thoughts when you\u2019re both asleep?",
        "Rose: Yep. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you were performing telekineses in your dream?",
        "Rose: Yeah, I guess so. Huh. I didn\u2019t even think of it like that. It just seemed like dream logic to me. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How frequently are you able to control other people\u2019s dreams?",
        "Rose: I don\u2019t know. Like, sixty percent of the time, maybe? But I\u2019m getting better. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Rose, how much have you been dream walking since leaving the AM?",
        "Rose: Every night. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Just at night?",
        "Rose: Okay, so I\u2019ve made a few little day trips. But it\u2019s only been two or three times in the past week, I promise. And it\u2019s mostly been into my own subconscious. Going into other people\u2019s heads when they\u2019re awake is a little unpredictable. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Which you enjoy. ",
        "Rose: Yeah, I know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to stay away from it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s still remarkable to me that you can dreamwalk when others are conscious. ",
        "Rose: It is different, though. Things are more static-y and frantic. Harder to move through. But it does the job in a pinch. Okay, okay, I know that I sound like an addict. I didn\u2019t mean it like that.",
        "Dr. Bright: How did you mean it?",
        "Rose: I really have been doing better since The AM. It\u2019s just- it\u2019s hard. Did you ever read any fantasy novels when you were a kid?",
        "Dr. Bright: Some. Why?",
        "Rose: They\u2019re not really my thing these days, but I read all the Narnia books growing up. Did you ever read those?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I did. Mar- my brother was a big fan. ",
        "Rose: Right, okay, so you know the gist. I loved them because that idea of climbing through a wardrobe and finding another world was just amazing. And then watching things like Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz...when you\u2019re a kid, you hope that there\u2019s some magical land out there for you to stumble upon. And, as you grow up, you realize that there isn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t believe anyone who says they\u2019re fine with that, because it is crazy disappointing. But I found it. An actual magical world. And I can access it whenever and anything is possible there but it\u2019s also completely safe because it\u2019s not real. But it feels real. And I can\u2019t give it up. I won\u2019t. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No one is asking you to. As I said, we can\u2019t treat this like other, non-atypical addictions. Your ability is part of you.",
        "Rose: Can we stop calling it an addiction? It makes me feel like a failure or something. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Rose, before you went into The AM, there were days when you were only awake for two or three hours. You were missing work, not talking to your family, or Emily\u2014",
        "Rose: That only lasted for a few days. I could have stopped it. I mean, I did stop it. Yeah, it helped to go to The AM, but I did the work. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I know. You should be proud of yourself for getting help when you needed it - that\u2019s an extremely difficult thing to do. And Rose, you\u2019re not a failure. Addiction is not failure. Struggling is not failing. As long as we keep trying, we don\u2019t fail.",
        "Rose: But what does that mean for me? I don\u2019t want to stop dreamwalking. I couldn\u2019t, even if I wanted to. Like you said, it\u2019s part of me. I\u2019ll dreamwalk regardless. I might as well do it on purpose. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then it\u2019s about finding balance. The dreamwalking in itself is not inherently a problem. But the habits you formed around it were creating issues in your life. Those are what we need to focus on. ",
        "Rose: Right. ",
        "Dr. Bright: At The AM, did you talk about why you were feeling the impulse to dreamwalk? ",
        "Rose: A little. It was all the same stuff that we\u2019ve talked about before - the fact that it\u2019s exciting, that it\u2019s so much more surprising than real life. I get to take risks and see new things without any consequences. Other than learning things about people which, yeah, can sometimes be awkward. But it\u2019s worth it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How are you feeling about other aspects of your life? Outside of the dreamwalking. ",
        "Rose: Good. Fine. A new assistant chef started at the restaurant and she\u2019s sort of taken me under her wing, which has been really great. But I worry that being away for two weeks will have ruined that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019m sure she understood that you needed to focus on your health first. ",
        "Rose: I guess. It's just frustrating to miss out on things because of my ability. Even when it\u2019s frustrating to be in the real world.",
        "Dr. Bright: But feeling that way also means that there are things in your life outside of dreams that you value. ",
        "Rose: True. Sometimes I wish I didn\u2019t straddle the two worlds, you know? That I could just pick: dream world or real world. And I don\u2019t know which I would pick, it changes day to day, but it\u2019s exhausting to jump back and forth. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How do you mean?",
        "Rose: It\u2019s like I belong in both places and also don\u2019t belong in either. And that\u2019s not a new feeling - being in an atypical family and having to hide that, I always felt like I was living two lives. Hell, even being gay in a mostly straight world feels like that sometimes. But this is different from all that.",
        "Dr. Bright: In what way?",
        "Rose: It feels more concrete. It\u2019s literally two different worlds. The way I relate to people now is completely different. I can bring information from dream world into my real life if I want, but then there are times when I don\u2019t want the other person to know that I know something. Especially if it\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t know what I am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Have you told Emily yet?",
        "Rose: No. I\u2019m going to. I really, really am. I just keep chickening out. And I hate it! That\u2019s not who I am. I\u2019m not a coward. And I\u2019m not dishonest. But it\u2019s just so much harder than I thought it would be. And we\u2019ve been dating seriously for nearly three months now and I know I have to tell her but the longer I wait, the more guilty I feel and the less I want to tell her so I keep putting it off and it just goes round and round. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you worry she\u2019ll react badly?",
        "Rose: I have no idea how she\u2019ll react, that\u2019s the problem. She knows about the narcolepsy, which was already weird enough\u2014",
        "Dr. Bright: Thousands of people have narcolepsy. It\u2019s not weird\u2014",
        "Rose: I know, I know, I gave her the whole spiel. And she took it in stride, like she does with everything, but adding a completely fake-sounding, fantasy-novel condition on top of that might be a hard pill to swallow. I don\u2019t know that\u2019d she\u2019d believe me. I wouldn\u2019t believe me if I hadn\u2019t grown up in this world.",
        "Dr. Bright: Is this something you've talked to Aaron at all about? Has he dated non-atypicals?",
        "Rose: Yeah, he has. But he\u2019s never told any of them about his ability. I love my brother, but he\u2019s kind of the worst when it comes to girls. I don't think he's had a relationship that lasted longer than three weeks since his telepathy started up. He says he gets bored of people really quickly because there\u2019s no mystery to them now. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you ever feel that way now that you get to see into peoples\u2019 subconscious minds?",
        "Rose: Are you kidding? Some people are more of a mystery now. First of all, the subconscious is a really wacky place. Half the time things don\u2019t make sense at all. And secondly, it\u2019s where people put all their repressed stuff so a lot of what I see completely contradicts what someone does or says in their normal life. ",
        "Dr. Bright: In what way?",
        "Rose: Take Aaron for example. Whenever he dreams about me or my parents, he\u2019s so loving about it. In reality, he\u2019s kind of a jerk. I mean, I love him and I know he loves me, but we\u2019ve always been super competitive and that makes our relationship kind of combative, I guess. He would never be as affectionate with me as he is in his dreams. Dream me, I mean. When I\u2019m there and he knows, it\u2019s pretty much the same. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Hence the snowball fight. ",
        "Rose: Exactly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But that sounds like going into his dreams help you understand him more, not less. ",
        "Rose: It\u2019s connecting the thread, you know? Seeing how he feels in his subconscious and then dealing with him in real life, it\u2019s like two different people. And I can\u2019t figure out why he acts the way he acts sometimes because that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s at his core. ",
        "Dr. Bright: You said you\u2019re both combative - why do you think you behave that way?",
        "Rose: Because he does?",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that all?",
        "Rose: He\u2019s older. He started it. I guess we\u2019re both afraid of being vulnerable? And now that we each have this weird window into each other\u2019s heads, it feels even scarier to be vulnerable in reality. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is there someone you feel you\u2019re able to be vulnerable with in your real life?",
        "Rose: Present company excluded?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Rose: I want to say Emily but she doesn\u2019t know this huge piece of me. I feel like I can talk to her about anything and everything except this. And at first it was fine but for the past month as it\u2019s become a bigger and bigger part of my life, it\u2019s made it hard to be myself around her. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you think finding a balance with your dreamwalking will make you feel more comfortable with her?",
        "Rose: I think telling her would make me feel more comfortable. But I just don\u2019t know how to do it. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Where is the resistance to the idea coming from?",
        "Rose: That she'll call me a freak? That she\u2019ll break up with me?",
        "Dr. Bright: How would you feel if that happened?",
        "Rose: Completely devastated. I think\u2014 I think if I let myself, I could fall in love with her pretty quickly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: If you let yourself?",
        "Rose: I\u2019ve been trying to keep a bit of mental distance because, well, I\u2019m scared. If I let myself fall head over heels and then tell her and she rejects me, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. And then there\u2019s my mom. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Your mom? What do you mean?",
        "Rose: Her precognition. She\u2019s never been all that crazy about any of my girlfriends. She\u2019s liked them fine but hasn\u2019t made a big effort to get to know them because she'd always know that they weren\u2019t serious, even if I didn\u2019t. But with Emily, she\u2019s totally different. She\u2019s constantly inviting her over to Shabbat and asking me about her and it\u2019s so weird. She's way too invested. ",
        "Dr. Bright: This is the first person you've dated since your ability started, isn\u2019t it? Do you think that might have something to do with your mother\u2019s behavior?",
        "Rose: Oh yeah, maybe. I hadn\u2019t even thought about that. I finally asked her about it the other day and all she said was, \u201cEmily is important\u201d. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Did she tell you why?",
        "Rose: No. She tried to make it sound all mysterious but I don't think she totally knows why herself. It\u2019s not always clear visions with her. Sometimes it\u2019s just more impressions. Like, she can feel it in her gut that Emily is going to be an important person in my life, but not how. I mean, I doubt she\u2019s the woman I marry because, hello, I\u2019m not even twenty, but maybe, I don\u2019t know, maybe she\u2019s the first person I tell about my ability?",
        "Dr. Bright: Is it important to you for your mother to be right?",
        "Rose: My mother is right. She\u2019s always right. She\u2019s really good at what she does. Even when it\u2019s inexact. ",
        "Dr. Bright: How have you dealt with your mother\u2019s predictions in the past? Do you use them to make decisions?",
        "Rose: She usually doesn\u2019t tell me when she sees stuff about me. Unless it\u2019s practical. You know: \u201ctake an umbrella today\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t go near Bobby or his brothers this week because they all have the chicken pox and don\u2019t know it yet\u201d. That kind of stuff. But she doesn\u2019t tell me or Aaron the big things. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why not?",
        "Rose: She wants us to make our own decisions. She says even though she can\u2019t help making choices based off what she knows, she wants us to have free will. Not to be ruled by destiny. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But she told you about Emily. ",
        "Rose: I pestered her about it for a few days. I could tell she knew something and it was driving me nuts. But now I see her point. I feel like there\u2019s a right choice to make but I don\u2019t know what that is. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Were your strong feelings for Emily there before you talked to your mother?",
        "Rose: Yes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then why does it feel different? She was already important to you. ",
        "Rose: The stakes feel higher now. There\u2019s something bigger for me to mess up. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And how do you think you\u2019re going to mess it up?",
        "Rose: By telling her or not telling her. There\u2019s no good answer. I tell her, she might freak and leave. I don\u2019t tell her and we get serious, I have to hide who I am forever. I want an option C. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you think option C would be?",
        "Rose: To stop dreamwalking. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you said yourself you don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. ",
        "Rose: That\u2019s what I thought at first but the AM, the pills they gave me - they worked really well. Totally dreamless sleep. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And that could be a long term solution? I thought those drugs were only for detox. ",
        "Rose: I guess they\u2019ve tweaked the formula, because they said they were basically like normal sleeping pills now. I could take them regularly. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Is that what you want to do?",
        "Rose: No. But it might be a good idea, right? So that I don\u2019t go down that road again?",
        "Dr. Bright: It certainly helps to have the option. That\u2019s not the case for all atypicals. ",
        "Rose: Ugh, I know, Aaron is always complaining about how there isn\u2019t a pill in the world that can fix his headaches when they get bad.",
        "Dr. Bright: Many nonatypical people take sleeping pills when they are having a hard time getting fulfilling rest. This doesn't have to be different. Did you go over everything with a physician at The AM?",
        "Rose: Yeah. They said the same thing - that it\u2019s basically a like normal sleeping pill. I just take them when things get to be a little too much. They seemed to think I could take them every night, though. ",
        "Dr. Bright: If they really are like normal sleeping pills, those can become addicting on their own. That may not be the best long term solution. However, if The AM has been making strides in psychotropic medicine that works on atypicals, that could help you get on the path to addressing the underlying relationship you have to your dreamwalking.",
        "Rose: I think the sleeping pills are as far as they\u2019ve gotten, so I guess there isn\u2019t really an option C after all. I mean, I\u2019m happy to take the medicine when I need it, but the truth is, I don\u2019t want to stop. Towards the end of the week of dreamless nights, I started to feel groggy and weird again. I think you\u2019re right. I think it is about balance. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Then you do what is going to help you find that balance. As long as it\u2019s within the bounds of what your doctor said was safe for you to do. And if there are any problems or you want to reevaluate, you should call them right away. ",
        "Rose: Are there other atypical doctors? You know, outside of The AM? My family has always gone there for atypical-related stuff and to a normal doctor for everything else. Do you know of anyone who does both?",
        "Dr. Bright: Not currently. But if you\u2019re not happy with your AM physician, I\u2019m sure you could ask Agent Green\u2014",
        "Rose: No, no, it\u2019s not that. My doctor is fine. It\u2019s\u2014 you used to work there, right? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. ",
        "Rose: Did you ever get the feeling that something weird was going on?",
        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Rose: Something shady. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Rose, did something happen while you were there?",
        "Rose: No, no, nothing happened. Not to me, anyway. I was dreamwalking and I found myself in another patient\u2019s dreams and it was, I don\u2019t know, it wasn\u2019t good. At first I thought it was just a nightmare but then when I was leaving, he was checking out at the same time. I recognized him from his dream. And I introduced myself, because if there\u2019s any place where you can go up to someone and say, \u201chey, I was in your dream last night, can I ask you some questions about it\u201d, it\u2019s at The AM. ",
        "Dr. Bright: What did he say?",
        "Rose: He was freaked. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk there but we exchanged numbers and I\u2019m getting coffee with him tomorrow. I don\u2019t know, the whole thing feels pretty hinky. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are you sure you should be meeting with this person? ",
        "Rose: Yeah, it\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re meeting in public, in the middle of the day. And besides, he\u2019s atypical too, so it doesn't matter that he knows I am. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you know what his ability is?",
        "Rose: No. Nothing that was immediately obvious. He just seemed so scared in his dream. I want to know why. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. ",
        "Rose: You never saw anything suspicious there? At The AM?",
        "Dr. Bright: I can\u2019t talk about my time there - it\u2019s all completely confidential. But you\u2019ve had a good experience. The most important thing is to find physicians that you trust. As long as you feel you're making progress, that\u2019s what matters. ",
        "Rose: Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, I\u2019ll see this guy tomorrow and see what he says. I definitely don\u2019t want to go to an organization that\u2019s doing something unethical. Plus, it\u2019s nice to make new atypical friends. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s very true. It\u2019s important to have a community of people you feel you can be yourself with. ",
        "Rose: Exactly. Ugh, god, this whole conversation has been weirdly stressful. Could we- do you think it would be alright for me to take a quick walk?",
        "Dr. Bright: Do you want to walk to relax or to escape?",
        "Rose: To escape. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Why don\u2019t we try a little meditation first and see how you feel. ",
        "[sfx: time passes]",
        "Dr. Bright: How are you feeling now?",
        "Rose: Better. Less like I want to run away into dreams. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s good. This week I want you to try those mindfulness exercises when you feel the impulse to dreamwalk during the day. And try to pay attention to where that impulse is coming from. ",
        "Rose: Okay, I can do that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Call me if you have any concerns. ",
        "Rose: Will do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you\u2019ll tell your parents where you\u2019re getting coffee tomorrow? You\u2019ll leave if you feel at all uncomfortable?",
        "Rose: I will, I promise. And maybe if he needs more help, I could introduce you guys? It seemed like The AM wasn\u2019t really helping him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: My door is always open. ",

        "Sam: And this friend knows how to help you?",
        "Chloe: He might. He used to be a librarian - information science guy, kind of like you - and he knows about atypicals. I guess a bunch of stuff went down when he and my mom were working together. Like bad things. ",
        "Sam: What kind of bad things?",
        "Chloe: I don\u2019t know. My mom is so good at keeping her secrets and especially now, I have no way of getting to them. But I think it had something to do with The AM. Which would definitely explain why my mom has always been insistent about me staying away from them. ",
        "Sam: Did she get taken by them once?",
        "Chloe: No, I don\u2019t think so. Ugh, it\u2019s so frustrating, because I just get snippets from her thoughts and she won\u2019t talk about it so I\u2019m having to piece together all this information. ",
        "Sam: So, wait, why does this mean you have to go away? Is your mom worried about The AM doing something?",
        "Chloe: No, no, nothing like that. I think she used to be worried about that because I used to hear stuff in her thoughts whenever I would bring up The AM. She would think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t do all that just to have them take her\u201d- her being me, I guess. ",

We used to be so close - I thought we told each other everything. But I guess knowing someone\u2019s thoughts can mean knowing they don\u2019t always tell the truth.",

        "Sam: And you want to do this?",
        "Chloe: I think I need to do this. Being around people before was hard but rewarding. Getting to see people\u2019s thoughts, know people in that way, it was beautiful. And now it\u2019s fractured and broken in a way that grates. It\u2019s frustrating and painful and just constantly reminds me what I\u2019m missing. I think some quiet would do me good. And if he can help me great, but if not - at least I\u2019ll have my own brain to myself for a little while.",

But I\u2019m honestly really looking forward to being in a place with nobody around for miles. Mr. Sandoval teaches four days a week so I\u2019ll mostly have the place to myself during the day. I can take walks and keep practicing watercolors and listen to music and actually hear it for once.",

I mean, I know I\u2019ve done that - poked my head where it doesn\u2019t belong, used my ability in ways that crossed a line. But I\u2019m worried about what my mom has been hiding from me. I\u2019m worried she did something to protect me that hurt someone else. And I know she\u2019s a good person, but I didn\u2019t think I could still be surprised by who someone is.

        "Rose: And how are you planning on dealing with someone like Damien?",

Atypicals who want revenge. And I\u2019m\u2014 I\u2019m in the middle of that. That\u2019s- that's why I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m not sacred of you, Caleb, I could never be scared of you. But you can get lost in your own ability. You all do. And sometimes I wish I could just make you all look up and realize that Dr. Bright and I aren\u2019t your sidekicks.

        "Sam: There won\u2019t be if you tell him to go. ",
        "Mark: Yeah. ",
        "Caleb: But what if he leaves and then gets his powers back? Then we\u2019re just, like, unleashing him on people who have no idea what he can do. ",

        "Dr. Bright: A way that would ideally make it so we knew before Ellie did. ",
        "Sam: Exactly. But this way he would at least be out of our lives.",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s imperfect, but it might be our best option. Is everyone comfortable with that? Trying to just encourage him to go away? ",
        "Rose: You sound skeptical. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I haven\u2019t found that method particularly effective in the past. ",
        "Adam: I\u2019d personally like to see him face actual consequences but if that means he\u2019s going to be locked away without a trial- I mean, god, the regular justice system is bleak enough already. ",
        "Caleb: Yeah, I think beating the guy\u2019s head in and making him powerless is enough justice for me. ",
        "Sam: I would definitely like to be able to walk around knowing I\u2019m not going to run into him. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Rose?",
        "Rose: Oh, um, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really part of this, but sure? At least now he\u2019s not the only atypical I know outside of my family anymore.",

Yeah, it drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes I want to hide from my own feelings and I can\u2019t when you\u2019re around but it also makes you who you are. I wouldn\u2019t want to change that. I wish- I wish it didn\u2019t make things hard for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d wish it away. ",

        "Damien: Does it matter?",
        "Mark: Of course it matters. Pretending to be my friend just to use my ability is not the same as being my friend. ",
        "Damien: Why can\u2019t it be both? Why couldn\u2019t I have been your friend and wanted to share my power? I didn\u2019t want to use you Mark, I wanted us to be together, to be equals\u2014",

        "Mark: Yeah, at first. But I begged you- I begged you to take me back to my sister and you made me believe that I couldn\u2019t trust her. You have no idea what that did to me, Damien. You and Wadsworth took something that was already fragile and you just- you shattered it. The person I love most in this world and you took her away from me. ",

        "Damien: Understand what?",
        "Mark: That I\u2019m telling you you hurt me. I\u2019ve told you over and over. And I need you to understand that that\u2019s real, no matter how much you try ignore me or try to justify what you did. You hurt me and that isn\u2019t something you get to control. ",

        "Mark: That\u2019s free will, Damien! It\u2019s not fair. None of it is fucking fair. And that\u2019s life. We bleed and fight and love and hate and hurt each other even when we don\u2019t mean to\u2014",
        "Damien: And I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014",

        "Mark: If you treat other people like disposable toys, eventually they\u2019re going to leave before you can throw them away. ",
        "Damien: But I didn\u2019t throw you away\u2014",
        "Mark: No, you just lied to me for months! Kept me in a little box that you only opened when it was convenient for you. And that was just to start. ",

        "Damien: Alright, look, you want to do this? You want to put it all out there? I\u2019m powerless. I hope it comes back - I really fucking hope it comes back - but I know that it might not. And I shouldn\u2019t have called you the other day but I- I wanted to hear your voice because this is hard. Living life like a normal person is hard. And The AM has been absolutely no help and I don\u2019t know what to do because I have no bank accounts, no license, no identity without my ability. But you\u2019re still here. And you came here today and that means something\u2014",
        "Mark: Damien, I came here to\u2014",

But you still shouldn\u2019t have come here because not enough time has passed. You\u2019re still pissed about what happened in November\u2014",
        "Mark: Of course I\u2019m still pissed about what happened in November\u2014",

        "Mark: We can what?",
        "Damien: I can\u2019t make you forget what I did anymore, but time is supposed to heal all wounds, right? You\u2019ll get over it eventually and then we can move on. But all of this fighting is just gonna slow that down so you know what, you should leave. ",
        "Mark: I\u2019m sorry, are you saying you\u2019ve just been biding your time? That\u2019s why you haven\u2019t contacted any of us? Because you just assumed that \u201ctime would heal all wounds\u201d and then you could be part of the gang?",
        "Damien: I mean, yeah. Not that I necessarily want to be part of the gang or anything - I mean, look,  your friends haven\u2019t exactly been good for my health - but we can get past this. You all flipped your lids and need time to cool off. And, hey, I get it, Mark, I do. I made some mistakes, I hurt you, but we all make mistakes, right?",
        "Mark: Yeah, Damien, we all make mistakes, but there are different fucking degrees of mistakes, you know? God, are you saying that if you did have your ability still that you would have just mind warped us all into forgiving you?",
        "Damien: There\u2019s nothing wrong with speeding along an inevitable process. ",
        "Mark: Of course there is! ",
        "Damien: Once my ability comes back, you won\u2019t even remember what you were mad about in the first place. It\u2019ll be like it never happened. ",
        "Mark: Wow, wow, okay, no, you know what? This is good. This is what I needed. ",
        "Damien: What?",
        "Mark: I needed confirmation that you actually are the unrepentant bastard everyone thinks that you are. ",
        "Damien: Is that why you came here? To make me the villain?",
        "Mark: No, Damien, I came here to- I wanted you to make a different choice, I guess. I hoped that maybe you\u2019d have changed a little. But you honest to god haven\u2019t learned a thing, have you? You never do. And I keep expecting you to and you don\u2019t and so I am ending this cycle right now. ",
        "Damien: What the hell does that mean?",
        "Mark: It means, Damien, that we\u2019re done. We are well and truly done. ",
        "Damien: Oh, come on, I was mostly kidding about making you forget. ",
        "Mark: No you weren\u2019t. God, I can\u2019t believe anything you say. I don\u2019t know if you or the ability came first but you\u2019re too twisted together for me to tell you apart. ",
        "Damien: Okay, but I don\u2019t have my power anymore. There\u2019s just me. And I\u2019m not a threat. ",
        "Mark: Of course you are. You\u2019re- you\u2019re poisonous. You- you want me to forgive you but you won\u2019t actually do anything about it - I don\u2019t think you really actually understand what you need to be forgiven for. So let\u2019s have a fun recap: you forced my sister to give you therapy and tell you things she would never tell anyone, you kidnapped me, lied to me, threatened to make the woman I love kill herself, attempted to kidnap a teenager, and then manipulated a completely innocent girl so you could get back in our lives. ",
        "Damien: I told you, that's not what went down with Rose\u2014",
        "Mark: And do you even know what you did to Chloe?",
        "Damien: What are you talking about, my ability never worked on her\u2014",
        "Mark: But physically assaulting her did. Did you know she\u2019s had a hard time using her power ever since you knocked her out? She\u2019s had to go away. She\u2019s in pain. And she might never recover, by the way. You did that. ",
        "Damien: I didn\u2019t know that\u2014",
        "Mark: And all the while, my head was so fucked up from you brainwashing me for months that I actually felt bad for you this whole time. I don\u2019t\u2014 you honestly made me question, like, reality and, yeah, I don\u2019t know what that says about me but I know that\u2019s not entirely my fault. The things you\u2019ve done are unforgivable. What you did to Chloe? Unforgivable. Sam and Adam- what you threatened to do to them, that is unforgivable. Do you understand that?",
        "Damien: I told you, I wouldn\u2019t have actually done anything\u2014",
        "Mark: Why should I believe a goddamn word that comes out of your mouth, Damien? You made me doubt myself - my own thoughts - and I\u2019m done compensating for that doubt by trusting in you. I\u2019m sorry that your life has been hard and I\u2019m sorry that you got fucked around by Wadsworth - that\u2019s the last thing I wanted, trust me. And I\u2019m honestly sorry I couldn\u2019t be what you needed. But this isn\u2019t good for either of us. And I\u2019m done trying to make you better. It just makes me feel worse. ",

        "Damien: What?",

In this episode, you heard the voices of Andrew Nowak as Mark, Lauren Shippen as Sam, Julia Morizawa as Dr. Bright, Briggon Snow as Caleb, Alex Gallner as Adam, Alanna Fox as Rose, and Alex Marshall-Brown as Wadsworth. Our music is composed and performed by Evan Cunningham. It feels unbelievable to say this but our next episode will be our 50th episode. I can\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve made it this far, and I\u2019m really excited about what we have planned for this milestone. But a big 50th episode - and every episode we\u2019ve made since Season 1 - would not be possible without the support of our patrons on Patreon. So thank you guys so much for supporting us. If you\u2019d like to join our strange and unusual family, and get more insight into how the show is made, you can go to patreon.com/thebrightsessions.

        "Caleb: Nah, I don\u2019t think so. I think you were just there at the end a bit. Like I was feeling your feelings and so it was like dream version you became more real or something. Plus the fact that you and Dr. Bright were talking about you and me at the same time... it's just a weird timing thing, I guess. ",

        "Adam: I know but Annabelle went there, you know? And that\u2019s why I fell in love with it in the first place. I always looked up to her and I thought going to the school she went to would help me to be just like her. ",
        "Caleb: That\u2019s not why you\u2019re going. You love it for lots of reasons. You\u2019ve spent hours telling me those reasons. It\u2019s not just because of Annabelle. ",

I wanted to get my degree - I had to, it was in the conditions of the trust my parents left for me - but I knew I couldn\u2019t go to big lectures or live in a dorm. I was traveling like, at least twice a day at that point - so, I did what I had to. But, all that aside, I loved college. Spending all day learning stuff, the independence. It\u2019s a fun time. ",

My alarm clock goes off - the same one I\u2019ve had since I was ten - and I can hear my mom\u2019s voice telling me to get up and go to school or\u2014 or I push back the curtains that I took from their bedroom and still smell her perfume. Even the stupid egg timer that my dad would use for trivia nights - I mean, well, you use it to cook now. ",

And it helped me remember them. Because I\u2019ve never been able to go back. Not to the good times. Ever since I started being able to control this thing I\u2019ve kept trying to get back to them, just to watch. Just so I can get the shape of their smiles and the sounds of their voices in my head again. But any time I try, it just takes me back to then.

        "Dr. Bright: That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to start happening all the time now. ",
        "Sam: No, I know, I know. I remember you telling me that just because the involuntary trips became less frequent didn\u2019t mean I was rid of them forever. It was just- it was just surprising and very unpleasant but I\u2019ll be okay. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about. ",

It would be everything. ",
        "Dr. Bright: That\u2019s not going to happen again. The fact that Camille could only travel in her mind meant she was vulnerable to threats in the present. Mark only got trapped because it was a mental time traveler. ",

I could feel Mark using my ability as his own. He wasn\u2019t just piggybacking, he was steering. I can\u2019t really describe it, but I just\u2014I know. It wasn\u2019t just mine anymore. ",

        "Dr. Bright: What do you mean?",
        "Sam: We both have nightmares a lot. Most of the time we just handle them on our own but sometimes it turns into a full blown, you know, post-traumatic episode or what have you, um, and we know how to calm each other down. Or, at least, weather the storm. ",

Could he use my power while I\u2019m asleep? I don\u2019t know why I thought we needed to do it together to make it work, but I\u2019ve been just sleeping next to him this whole time like I\u2019m not a danger to him. But I am. Time is huge.

They thought two Atypicals at once might help them actually affect the past. That\u2019s what they were trying to do with Camille when she died. They were giving her something to try and see if she could become corporeal in the past and it didn\u2019t work, of course. And it killed her. ",

        "Sam: But I hid! Always! I mean, today, about my parents, I realize how that sounded, I do. It\u2019s like what I said to Joan when I first met her - I\u2019m just a ghost, haunting this city, moving their things from house to house like some sort of shrine. That\u2019s\u2014 I know. I know how bad that is. I\u2019ve been living with the dead for so long - in my house, in the past, in my own head and I\u2014 I didn\u2019t know what it would be like. ",
        "Mark: What what would be like?",
        "Sam: Caring about people. People who are alive. How wonderful and terrifying it all is. I didn\u2019t know that my actions could have consequences because they never did before. Not since...well. I never had an effect on the world around me. And I got used to that. But that hasn\u2019t been true for a while now and I\u2019m not- I'm not adjusting to this new version of my life. ",

That is my metric for behavior\u2014 as long as I\u2019m not accidentally killing my loved ones, then I\u2019m okay, right? But I pressured Joan into starting this thing with me, I\u2019ve been spying on people in the past and I hurt you. I hurt you and that was the last thing I wanted to do. ",

And I keep doing things to try and make it less painful and none of it works. Because you\u2019re you and I\u2019m me and our lives are just filled with uncertainty and danger. And so I\u2019m- I'm just stuck. But I don\u2019t want to wait anymore. I want to move forward with you but I have no idea how. So I just keep pretending. I keep pretending that I know what I\u2019m doing, that I\u2019m confident in my decisions, that I know how to help. I keep pretending that I don\u2019t have nightmares all the time, that I didn\u2019t spend this morning hyperventilating on the bathroom floor. But I can\u2019t pretend anymore. ",

And then it was like the last few months were just on instant replay and I realized I\u2019ve just been grasping at anything that I could use as armor even if it meant leaving somebody else defenseless. And I- I don\u2019t want to be that person. I never want to hurt you again. ",

I don\u2019t want to do this alone anymore. I lose all perspective when I\u2019m alone. And I\u2019m not going to apologize for wanting to keep you safe, but I am sorry for trying to do it without you. I had no right. ",

You\u2019re one of the only things that\u2019s made me feel alive and here and solid and I\u2019ve been so focused on protecting that, I started to become someone I don\u2019t want to be.

        "Mark: Forgive me if I don\u2019t exactly trust you.",
        "Wadsworth: I am sorry, Mark. For treating you the way I did. I\u2019m sorry that it was necessary. ",
        "Sam: It wasn\u2019t necessary\u2014",
        "Wadsworth: Of course it was. We needed to learn more\u2014",
        "Mark: Oh, and you needed to make yourself immune? ",
        "Wadsworth: Yes, in fact, I did. It makes me more effective at my work. ",
        "Mark: I don\u2019t believe you. How do you not see anything wrong with what you did\u2014",
        "Wadsworth: Of course I do. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I just don\u2019t agree. And that\u2019s fine. You need that for progress - Joan will tell you \u2014 you need people who disagree. That\u2019s how you move forward. Get better. I\u2019m sure Sam and Joan here haven\u2019t agreed on every aspect of how to run their little pet project\u2014",
        "Sam: That\u2019s completely different. We\u2019re never physically harming anyone. We both want to help people. We agree on that. And that\u2019s all that matters. What we build won\u2019t use people. ",
        "Wadsworth: But you\u2019re building something using research that I conducted.  You haven\u2019t physically been there, but you\u2019ve still benefited from what I\u2019ve done. Dozens of people have. Do you think Mr. Sandoval would have known what to do with Chloe without the AM\u2019s research? That Damien would have survived Caleb\u2019s assault? The information we get from Tier 5 is invaluable for the wellbeing of all Atypicals. ",
        "Sam: Most of us have gotten on just fine without you. ",
        "Wadsworth: You know, Samantha, we\u2019re quite close to developing a drug that would regulate Class D abilities. Something only made possible by the work we did with Camille\u2014",
        "Mark: How dare you talk about her\u2014",
        "Wadsworth: Can you imagine what your life would be like if you\u2019d had access to resources that could have helped you manage your ability from the moment it presented? Your parents may still be alive, Samantha. No other AM facility was doing the kind of cutting edge work that I did. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s taken the steps to change things. You can look down your noses at it, but you\u2019ll all be thanking me in the future. ",
        "Mark: None of that justifies torturing people. ",

        "Sam: Is that truly how you see all Atypicals? As dangerous?",
        "Wadsworth: No, Samantha. But as Mark will confirm, most of his floor mates were the very dregs of humanity. ",
        "Mark: Camille was a good person. ",
        "Wadsworth: Camille used her ability to travel back into people\u2019s pasts and then blackmail them. ",
        "Mark: So what, anyone who lives a less than perfect life gets to go into your Wonka factory of superhumans?",
        "Wadsworth: What about Trevor, who used his telekinesis to squeeze the air out of his victim\u2019s lungs or Casey, who trapped people in their worst nightmares? What would you have done with them?",
        "Dr. Bright: And where exactly did taking Mark - and I imagine many other innocent individuals - fit into this?",
        "Wadsworth: Mark would have become dangerous eventually. ",

        "Mark: I was always careful. ",
        "Wadsworth: Your \u201ccareful\u201d clearly wasn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m sorry that you couldn\u2019t see it, Joan, but your brother was always on the brink of exploding and exposing all Atypicals. We couldn\u2019t have that. And look at him now. Not perfect, but his control is much improved. We did that.",
        "Dr. Bright: Don\u2019t pretend to know my family better than me, Ellie. ",
        "Wadsworth: Oh, but I do, Joan. You have always had the same problem - you care too much. Your love for people blinds you.",
        "Sam: She sees her patients as people, not things to be exploited. ",
        "Wadsworth: Oh really? My, how things can change in a year. And look at where your patients are now, Joan. Most of them aren\u2019t even in therapy anymore. You grew attached and you complicated their lives and that\u2019s not the way it's supposed to be. I may seem cold and unfeeling but that is what makes me good at my job. I couldn\u2019t do what I do if I cared the way Joan cared. ",
        "Dr. Bright: HQ must be thrilled to be gaining such an impartial mind. ",
        "Wadsworth: I think they are. I have solutions. Maybe we won\u2019t need to use them \u2014 I hope we won\u2019t \u2014 but HQ understands that it\u2019s important to have someone who can...how do I put it?",
        "Dr. Bright: Put down the rabid dog?",
        "Wadsworth: Yes, exactly. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to at least try and cure the rabies first. ",
        "Sam: What about the Order? Based off of everything I\u2019ve seen, they won\u2019t be happy with this. With you. ",
        "Wadsworth: That may be true. But you\u2019ve given me a gift in that regard. The Order will be made aware that they haven\u2019t had an ambassador in this Division for the past 7 years - an unfortunate oversight, I\u2019ll admit. They\u2019ll be brought up to speed on what\u2019s been going on - all the missteps. And this branch will be placed under review and properly reformed. Their attention will be here. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And meanwhile you\u2019ll be off imprisoning \u201cdangerous Atypicals\u201d in DC? ",
        "Wadsworth: Actually, no. HQ doesn\u2019t have outpatient or inpatient facilities. It is pure bureaucracy. You would love it, Green, if you weren\u2019t such a terrible politician. Speaking of, I need to get back to the office, I\u2019ve got a call in ten minutes. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Ellie.",
        "Wadsworth: I- I am sorry, Joan. For hurting you. And you, Mark, for what it\u2019s worth. You may be a bit unnatural, but that doesn\u2019t mean you deserved to be trapped in the past for two years. That was unfortunate\u2014",
        "Mark: Fuck you. ",
        "Wadsworth: That\u2019s fine. Make me the bad guy. But I am done meddling in your lives. You\u2019ll still be registered with the AM, of course, but I won\u2019t recommend you for further examination. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Are we supposed to be grateful for that?",
        "Wadsworth: You can feel however you want about it. It\u2019s an olive branch. Take it or don\u2019t. I know my intentions. I believe in what I\u2019m doing and I have more important things to focus on now. That\u2019s what matters. ",
        "Mark: I will take you down someday, Annabelle. I will make sure that you can\u2019t hurt anyone ever again. ",
        "Wadsworth: You\u2019re welcome to try, Mark. But let\u2019s be clear. I\u2019m giving you a free pass. All of you. But that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t intervene if you put the larger population at risk. If you put people in harm\u2019s way or risk revealing Atypicals to the public eye, I will stop you. But for now, I guess this is goodbye. I hope someday you\u2019re able to see things from my perspective. ",

And I think it might be the perfect job. I\u2019ll shoot the shows at night but during the day I\u2019ll be driving and then I can shoot whatever city we\u2019re in, hang out with the band.

        "Mark: I just\u2014 I don\u2019t want to leave and have you bury yourself in work again. Be honest, if I wasn\u2019t over here all the time, bugging you to watch movies or play cards, what would you be doing with your free time?",

        "Caleb: Yeah. ",
        "Dr. Bright: For what it\u2019s worth, you changed my life too. You reminded me why I joined this field in the first place. To help people. And the AM might be the best way to do that. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Ellie wasn\u2019t Director yet when I started there. But, yes, it worked. As far as I could tell. Now I wonder...in the beginning, I didn\u2019t have all the information. I don\u2019t think I had any idea of what was actually going on. Ellie and Owen were smart and capable and wanted the same things for Atypicals that I did. I\u2019m not sure what happened. ",
        "Caleb: Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you sad. I always seem to do it anyway, though. ",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s alright, Caleb. I guess I just don\u2019t know if the place corrupted the person or the other way around. ",
        "Caleb: Maybe a little bit of both?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I think you\u2019re probably right. Ellie and The AM both have their darker sides and they just brought them out in each other, I suppose. ",

But I, uh, I gave him something to keep him company. When I went looking for him, last summer, I kept a kind of audio diary. Recorded him a bunch of messages. And I never gave them to him. Too embarrassed I guess. But now he has them. To listen to while he drives. If he wants. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Of course. But I\u2019m more...it\u2019s funny. Earlier today I told Mark I was tired of being angry. But I think I was just tired of being angry at specific people. Because, in reality, I\u2019m fucking furious. ",

        "Dr. Bright: I\u2019ve= I've never been the idealist. I\u2019ve had no illusions about what\u2019s required for progress. I don\u2019t agree with Ellie - I don\u2019t think it has to be brutal to work - but I also have never tried to pretend that it\u2019s all sunshine and smiles. Caleb asked me if The AM had always been doing bad things and I realized that I didn\u2019t know, not really. I chose not to know. I knew there were Tiers that held more serious cases, but I didn\u2019t stop to think about what that really meant. Not until my work brought me further into that orbit. ",
        "Sam: But then you actually did something. You went looking. You tried to find out what was really going on. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, I did. But I worked there for years under the assumption that - even if The AM had some unsavory secrets - we were all working towards the same thing. I thought it was better than this. I still had some faint hope that the larger institution was working. That, no matter how slowly or painfully, we were moving forward, on the whole. But that isn\u2019t necessarily true. An organization that allows someone like Ellie to do what she\u2019s been doing...she\u2019s at fault, of course, but she\u2019s not the only one. And it is a massive disappointment, to be honest. ",
        "Sam: And this is you wanting to go work for them?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes. Because, hopefully, it means I can\u2019t break it more. Owen is right, he won\u2019t be that good at his job. He\u2019s too much of a yes man, even if he does have good intentions. ",
        "Sam: And you are definitely not a yes man. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m not spending one more day feeling bad about that. I\u2019ve broken so many rules, and some of them I feel conflicted about but, for the most part - at least when it came to the AM - the rules were bad in the first place. Being in a position where I can make the rules seems like something I should be doing. If I can\u2019t completely heal the wound, maybe- maybe I can at least stop the bleeding.  ",
        "Sam: And, well, you really want me to come with you?",
        "Dr. Bright: Why wouldn\u2019t I?",
        "Sam: It took me almost no time at all to go from complete recluse to someone who betrayed the people she cares about most. I may not be the most stabilizing influence. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But you\u2019re self-aware - you realized what you were doing and you stopped yourself. It\u2019s like what Owen said - maybe making the mistakes we have makes us uniquely suited to do better in the future. ",
        "Sam: Yeah. Maybe. ",
        "Dr. Bright: People?",
        "Sam: What?",
        "Dr. Bright: The people you care about most. ",
        "Sam: Yeah. You. Who else would I be talking about?",
        "Dr. Bright: You\u2014 you didn\u2019t betray me. ",
        "Sam: I broke your trust, Joan. By spying and by calling Damien. I know how badly you wanted to be rid of him - he hurt you too. It was selfish, me risking him getting back into our lives. And I\u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have said those things to you\u2014",
        "Dr. Bright: It\u2019s alright, Sam\u2014",
        "Sam: No, it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have put up with that, Joan. Not from me, not from anyone. You deserve better. And I'm- I\u2019m sorry.",

        "Sam: Oh. That\u2019s. Thank you, Joan. You don\u2019t know what that means. ",
        "Dr. Bright: I think I do. I\u2019ve been without a family myself for quite some time.",
        "Sam: Right. Well, not anymore. So...are we actually doing this? Are we going to work at the AM?",

        "Dr. Bright: Good?",
        "Sam: I just- if you had told me six months ago I\u2019d be sitting here, having this conversation, I definitely would have expected some anxiety. ",
        "Dr. Bright: And you\u2019re not anxious?",
        "Sam: Oh no, I am- I am definitely anxious. I'm just...I\u2019m also here. Those two things are not mutually exclusive, I\u2019m learning. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, they\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have to, you know. ",
        "Sam: I know. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Don\u2019t use this as another way to hide. ",
        "Sam: Don\u2019t use this as another way to distract from having a life outside of your job. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Touche\u0301. This might actually work. ",
        "Sam: Yeah. It might. Did you ever, in a million years, expect you\u2019d be going back?",
        "Dr. Bright: No. But I can\u2019t say anything in my life is really what I expected. ",

This episode was sound designed and produced by Mischa Stanton and all of our music is composed by Evan Cunningham. In this episode, you heard the voices of Julia Morizawa as Dr. Bright, Andrew Nowak as Mark, Ian McQuown as Agent Green, Anna Lore as Chloe, Briggon Snow as Caleb, and me as Sam. I also want to acknowledge the talents of the rest of our cast - Charlie Ian as Damien, Alex Gallner as Adam, Alex Marshall-Brown as Wadsworth, Phillip Jordan as Frank, Alanna Fox as Rose, and Reyn Beeler as Charlie Decker. This show wouldn\u2019t be what it was without the incredible abilities of our voice cast and I am so thankful to have had them all as part of this family. And a massive thank you to one of our unsung heroes - Elizabeth Laird - who has provided psychological consultation as well as the voice of Sarah, Dr. Bright\u2019s receptionist. This show wouldn\u2019t be a positive force for mental health without her. Elizabeth is also my sister so when I tell you The Bright Sessions would never have happened without her, I mean that in the largest sense. A lot of people have made this show possible through advice and support and simply being part of our community. So thank you to Elizabeth and Matthew Harrington, Ken Hertz, Ilyssa Adler, Paul Richards, Oswaldo Rossi, Authentic, Matthew Elblonk, Liz Campbell, and Meghan Fitzmartin for all of your expertise. I\u2019m especially grateful to the community of podcasters and writers that have lifted us up since the beginning - David Rheinstrom, Wil Williams, The Bello Collective, the teams at the Whisperforge, Wolf 359, and Wooden Overcoats, Ben Acker, Jeffrey Cranor, Joseph Fink, and so many more who helped us along the way. Becoming part of this audio drama family has been the best part of my career.",

I love popping into the discord or having our Q&As and getting to talk to you directly. You really are my strange and unusual family.",

        "Agent Green: Right. Okay, #4-A-5, that\u2019s another telekinetic, so unless there have been any changes...? No? Good, moving on. Patient five - that\u2019s a class E? Remind me: why is this one high risk?",
        "Dr. Bright: Um, they\u2019re a psychic. Or, they think they are. I\u2019m constantly trying to handle their delusions of grandeur. Not a danger to society really, just a danger to themselves. ",
        "Agent Green: Ah. Might want to think about re-categorizing them, that\u2019s a bit confusing. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Sure. ",
        "Agent Green: Great. Okay, patient #6-C-1 - oh yes, the shape shifter. One of my favorite abilities. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Shape-shifter might be going too far. They are still in the \u201cchanging hair and eye color\u201d phase, but I think there\u2019s a lot of potential there if the patient wants to explore it. ",
        "Agent Green: Well, let me know if they start growing a new face. Those ones are always impossible to log into the system. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to decide on just one photo for them.",

        "Dr. Bright: Indeed. Moving on - patient #7-B-3, emits electrical impulses at a very low level, trying to apply their power to a clean energy project with very mixed results. Patient #8-C-6, invisibility, a teenage subject so sometimes they just disappear when embarrassed but we\u2019re working on it. Patient #9-A-2, another crackpot psychic-",

        "Dr. Bright: A potential class E. Astral projection- right now they can simply move outside their body and observe but it\u2019s possible they may eventually be able to move into other bodies so I\u2019m keeping an eye. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Then why not give me custody now? Put him in a normal hospital where I can visit him, talk to him, hold his hand. Why keep him locked up?",
        "Agent Green: Because a normal hospital isn\u2019t equipped to deal with something like that and you know that. ",
        "Dr. Bright: But I am. I could get the proper equipment, monitor him, study his brainwaves, try to come up with a solution. I\u2019m better than half the scientists at The AM. ",

        "Dr. Bright: God, we have this argument every single time and every time you say you\u2019re going to put in a request and then I bring it up again and you just evade. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve always done. Just talk around the issue instead of actually coming up with a solution. That\u2019s what makes you such an excellent bureaucrat.",

        "Dr. Bright: Fair? How dare you talk to me about fairness. Fair would have been disclosing to me that our bosses had kidnapped my brother. Fair would have been helping me to get him out. ",

        "Dr. Bright: Maybe if I had had a little support it would have. ",

Take this recorder and wait in the bathroom until you hear us come into my office, then go out the other door into the waiting room.

The agent is thinking about how it\u2019s strange I have a more valuable power than my mother - that\u2019s sort of rude - and he\u2019s thinking about genetics. He\u2019s thinking about why Dr. Bright doesn\u2019t have a power when her brother does. Okay, here we go, come on, think about where Mark is - okay, nope. Now he\u2019s thinking about how cute and smart Dr. Bright is. Jesus, guy, get a grip. Okay, now we\u2019ve moved on to other patients, oh, and he\u2019s thinking about my mother again. I guess he\u2019s met her because I can see her in his thoughts. Except she\u2019s younger. He likes her - thinks she\u2019s nice. Dr. Bright is thinking about her as well, but she\u2019s worried, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about my mother or me- thanks Dr. Bright. I can tell you\u2019re looking out. I think I\u2019m beginning to get why Dr. Bright likes taking notes this way - this is kind of fun. Oh, wow! Someone who can make fire that is so cool.

        "Damien: Like I said, Dr. Bright told me. I\u2019ve been her patient for a long time - she tells me stuff. So, can you hear what I\u2019m thinking right now?",

        "Chloe: What do you mean?",
        "Damien: Well, she\u2019s got this theory that my power doesn\u2019t work on you because the way our abilities function is incompatible. Like the same end of two magnets - they\u2019re too similar to work on each other. ",
        "Chloe: Do you hear people\u2019s thoughts too?",
        "Damien: Not exactly. More like I put thoughts into people\u2019s heads. Like I did with Sarah just then - I just planted the thought that she wanted a coffee and voila! ",
        "Chloe: You can make people do whatever you want?",
        "Damien: In a sense, yes.",

        "Chloe: No.",

        "Damien: What? You\u2019re not enjoying the silence? It must get pretty noisy hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts all the time. ",

        "Chloe: Cold. Barren. Total wasteland as far as I can tell. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, that\u2019s a bit harsh. ",
        "Chloe:  Well, it\u2019s your mind. ",
        "Damien: And it bothers you? Oh, it scared you. That first time I saw you here, you looked at me and you were totally freaked out. Is that why?",
        "Chloe: Yes. Feeling everyone\u2019s minds all the time isn\u2019t exactly pleasant to begin with but I would rather stand in a crowd that face whatever\u2019s going on in your head. ",
        "Damien: Oh. I didn\u2019t realize I was causing so much discomfort. ",
        "Chloe: Well, I imagine it\u2019s uncomfortable for you too - not being able to use your twisted power on me. ",
        "Damien: No, actually. Like I said, it\u2019s kind of nice. Believe it or not, it\u2019s not always a walk in the park having people do what you want. ",
        "Chloe: I doubt that. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, okay, let me guess - you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m lying through my teeth right now. I bet you\u2019re thinking \u201cgosh, I sure want him to be honest with me\u201d. Well, imagine thinking that and then having it come true. Any time I want someone to tell me the truth, they do. And while that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem for you anyway, it can really sting when you don\u2019t see it coming. ",
        "Chloe: Maybe if you were a better person, the truth wouldn\u2019t hurt as much.",
        "Damien: Okay. That\u2019s a fair shot. All I\u2019m saying is this: we were both born with these powers. No point in not using them. ",
        "Chloe: Yeah, but how are you using it? Like, what would you be making me do right now if your ability worked on me?",
        "Damien: Honestly, I probably wouldn\u2019t even be talking to you. ",
        "Chloe: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Damien: I don\u2019t go out of my way to talk to people. Especially normal people. The only reason I wanted to meet you was because my ability didn\u2019t work. ",
        "Chloe: Are you trying to tell me you don\u2019t use your power at all?",
        "Damien: No, of course I do. But I\u2019ve never done anything really bad with it. ",
        "Chloe: I would hate to learn what your definition of \u201cbad\u201d is. ",
        "Damien: Likewise. Which brings us back to the subject at hand - what are you doing here? I know for a fact that Dr. B has a meeting right now. ",
        "Chloe: And how would you know that?",
        "Damien: I may have finagled her calendar from Sarah. ",
        "Chloe: See what I mean? That would fit into any person\u2019s definition of \u201cbad\u201d. ",
        "Damien: And where does spying fit in, huh? Yeah, I can put two and two together. Why would the good doctor invite her young patient to sit in her waiting room while she had a meeting? ",
        "Chloe: Oh, I don\u2019t know, maybe I have an appointment. ",
        "Damien: No, you usually come in on Tuesdays. ",
        "Chloe: Excuse me? Are you following me?",
        "Damien: No. I just - I notice things. I spend a lot of time in this area and I\u2019m observant. ",
        "Chloe: Sure.",
        "Damien: Bet you\u2019re really wishing you could read my mind right now, am I right?",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s not bad to want to know if someone is lying to you. You say it\u2019s so hard to deal with someone\u2019s honesty but I do that all the time. People are honest when they think. ",
        "Damien: Oh, come on, I mean, I get that you\u2019re a rainbows and sunshine kind of gal, but you don\u2019t really believe that do you? People lie to themselves all the time. Out loud and otherwise. It\u2019s a little different than being compelled to tell the truth. ",
        "Chloe: Then stop compelling people. ",
        "Damien: I have stopped, in fact. Well, I mean, mostly. I\u2019m recovered. Like an alcoholic. But one who still drinks occasionally. ",
        "Chloe: You do know what recovered means right?",
        "Damien: I\u2019m just saying that I\u2019ve gotten better. But growing up like this was tricky. I mean, you must get that, right? Telepathy can\u2019t have been an easy thing to deal with as a kid.",
        "Chloe: My ability only started recently and I have had no trouble learning to control myself so forgive me if I don\u2019t buy your excuses. ",
        "Damien: Really? Well that\u2019s certainly interesting. See? Isn\u2019t it fun learning about each other? We share this thing that not many other people would get. Talking to Dr. B is all fine and dandy but she can\u2019t really ever understand what it\u2019s like. Even if it does run in her blood. ",
        "Chloe: What?",
        "Damien: Well, you know, her brother.",
        "Chloe: How do you know so much about Dr. Bright? Have you forced her to tell you things about her personal life?",
        "Damien: Well, kind of. I mean, I wanted to know, so she told me. I\u2019ve gotten better but I still slip up from time to time. Okay, so sometimes I slip up on purpose. But once I found out that she worked with other atypicals well - I just had to know everything about her. I think that\u2019s fair. ",
        "Chloe: It\u2019s hideous. You can\u2019t force someone to tell you their intimate feelings. ",
        "Damien: Yeah, and how do you know about Dr. Bright\u2019s brother, huh? He\u2019s not someone she just chats about. Yeah, I thought so. We\u2019re not so different you and I. ",
        "Chloe: I just hear what someone is already thinking; you make them think things, that\u2019s totally different.",
        "Damien: But the people you hear don\u2019t have a choice over what they tell you. I bet most of them don\u2019t even know! I mean, you\u2019re Big Brother, snatching information from them without telling them. At least people want to tell me things. ",
        "Chloe: But only because you make them. They don\u2019t have a choice either. I doubt many people would thank you for that. Especially Dr. Bright. ",
        "Damien: You\u2019re right. They don\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry, I would never hurt Dr. B. I know you\u2019re scared of me, which, if we\u2019re being honest is sort of ironic because you are probably the last person on the planet who has a reason to be, but I value the doc very much. She\u2019s like the big sister I never had. ",
        "Chloe: Somehow I doubt she thinks the same about you-",
        "[sfx: opening door]",
        "Dr. Bright: Damien. What the hell are you doing here? ",
        "Damien: What up, Doc? ",
        "Agent Green: Dr. Bright, is that how you address your patients? ",
        "Dr. Bright: Um, oh, no- Damien isn\u2019t a patient. He\u2019s...",
        "Damien: I\u2019m a friend. Her closest friend in fact. ",
        "Agent Green: I see. Uh, well- well, I guess I should get out of your hair. Leave you to your Friday night. Oh- I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see you there, miss. My goodness, this is a very busy waiting room for a Friday afternoon. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, indeed. Hello Ch- Christine. You\u2019re here to pick up Sarah, correct?",
        "Chloe: Um, yes. Yep, we were just about to head out.",
        "Agent Green: Oh yes, where is Sarah?",
        "Chloe: Uh, bathroom.",
        "Agent Green: Ah, well - well, give her my best. Lovely girl. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Absolutely. Goodbye, Agent Green. Have a pleasant weekend. ",
        "Agent Green: Thank you, Dr. Bright. You as well. Well, all of you. All of you have a nice weekend. ",
        "Damien: Thanks, Agent. Pleasure to meet you. ",
        "Agent Green: Sure. Bye now. ",
        "[sfx: opening and closing door]",
        "Dr. Bright: Damien, this is completely crossing the line - Chloe are you alright - what on earth do you think you\u2019re doing?",
        "Damien: I was in the neighborhood and thought I\u2019d drop by. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Of course. And this has nothing to do with the meeting I just had?",
        "Damien: Ah yes, Agent Green. Spiffy looking fellow you got there Dr. B. How are things at The AM?",
        "Chloe: He knows about The AM?",
        "Damien: Wait, she knows about The AM? Ah, right, of course, you were spying you little minx. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Oh don\u2019t try to be cute, Damien. ",
        "Chloe: Why did you lie to Agent Green about who Damien was just now? They don\u2019t know about Damien? They think he\u2019s a psychic?",
        "Damien: A psychic, really?",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, you reading my mind doesn\u2019t actually serve us if you keep relaying everything out loud. ",
        "Damien: Oh, wow cool, she really can read minds.",
        "Chloe: Oh, right. Sorry. ",
        "Damien: Wait, but seriously, why not tell them about me? Wouldn\u2019t that be the easiest way to get rid of me?",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, Damien, it would be and don\u2019t think it hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. But The AM has never met someone of your ability so if I were to hand you over they would immediately lock you up and experiment on you. Stick you with needles and electrodes and do all manner of things to get the root of the power. And then they would extract it and exploit it for their own gain. And while you are a very irritating, power-tripping man, you aren\u2019t actually the antichrist you aspire to be so I\u2019m willing to put up with you if it means those people don\u2019t gain even more power.",
        "Damien: Oh. Okay, then. Well. I can see I\u2019m not wanted here. I\u2019ll be back next week for a session, Dr. B. See you around, Chloe. ",
        "[sfx: opening and closing door]",
        "Chloe: Are you sure you don\u2019t want to hand him over, Dr. Bright? You\u2019re sure you\u2019re not, you know, under his influence?",
        "Dr. Bright: Quite sure. His ability wears off fairly quickly and, anyway, I\u2019ve become good at resisting it. ",
        "Chloe: But, I don\u2019t know, maybe he could be used as leverage. To get Mark back.",
        "Dr. Bright: Chloe, I\u2019m surprised at you. ",
        "Chloe: I just meant, he doesn\u2019t seem like a very good guy. ",
        "Dr. Bright: No, he\u2019s not. And you should definitely stay away from him. But he\u2019s not an evil guy either. He\u2019s just- well, he\u2019s just a bit pathetic to be honest.",
        "Chloe: But you hate him. You\u2019re scared of him. That\u2019s what I heard you thinking when he first- oh, you\u2019re scared of how you feel when you see him, not what he\u2019ll make you do. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Damien\u2019s an ass, yes, but he\u2019s never actually broken any major laws. Well, beyond some petty pickpocketing of my things but- yes, when I see him, talk to him, I just think: what would I do if I had his power? He just uses it to try and spend time with people, only to be disappointed when he realizes they wouldn\u2019t be pretending to like him if he weren\u2019t projecting his own desire for company. Well, now he mostly uses it to skip lines in shops, I think. But if I could do what he does, well, Mark wouldn\u2019t be locked up that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m not sure what lines I wouldn\u2019t cross. ",
        "Chloe: And that\u2019s what scares you. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes.",
        "Chloe: He really does suck though. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Yes, he does. Were you able to hear anything from Agent Green?",
        "Chloe: No, I\u2019m sorry, I was listening but then Damien came in and distracted me and- no. ",
        "Dr. Bright: Okay. Well, Damien made this particular mess so I may call on him to clean it up. ",
        "Chloe: You mean-? Are you sure that\u2019s wise?",
        "Dr. Bright: There are a few more avenues to explore but I don\u2019t want to risk any more people. I certainly don\u2019t want to rope you back into this. Damien is the very definition of expendable. Oh- do you have my recorder?",
        "Chloe: Oh, yeah, sorry here you go-",
        "[sfx: click of a recorder]",
